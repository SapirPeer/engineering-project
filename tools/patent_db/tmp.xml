<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an optical writing apparatus having a function of superposing an unauthorized copy protection pattern (such a function being referred to as an unauthorized copy protection function, hereinafter), an image forming apparatus such as a copier or a digital multi-function peripheral (MFP) having a copying function, and a computer readable information recording medium storing a program for controlling operation of the optical writing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, in a copier generally used, the unauthorized copy protection function is mounted. The unauthorized copy protection function is a function for which a first image processing apparatus prints an image after superposing an unauthorized copy protection pattern on given image data. A second image processing apparatus has a function of preventing itself from carrying out unauthorized copying operation. When the second image processing apparatus reads the image in which the unauthorized copy protection pattern has been thus superposed, the second image processing apparatus recognizes the unauthorized copy protection pattern. As a result, the second image protection apparatus treats the image as an unauthorized copy protection image, and thus the second image processing apparatus is controlled to prevent itself from printing the unauthorized copy protection image. Thus, copy protection is achieved. In order that the unauthorized copy protection function actually work well, the second image processing apparatus should positively recognize from the read image the unauthorized copy protection pattern superposed by the first image processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 2004-237687 discloses a method and apparatus. In the method and apparatus, a thermally reversible printing medium is used which has a thermally reversible recording layer in which visible information can be displayed and erased, because thermal energy reversibly changes a state of the thermally reversible recording layer between a coloring state and an erasing state. In the thermally reversible printing medium, information is embedded such as whether copying is allowed, a copyright, a confidential term and characteristics of the printing medium. The embedded information is read and analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent No. 3078433, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 7-273984 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,647,010 disclose image processing apparatuses having functions of unauthorized copy protection.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently, when a so-called A0 wide machine is used as an image forming apparatus or an image processing apparatus to print an image, a dot shape of one dot may be such that a size is larger and it has a long shape in a vertical direction as a whole (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>c</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>c</i>)), in comparison to a case where a common so-called LD writing machine is used as an image forming apparatus or an image processing apparatus to print an image. This is because an LED print head (abbreviated as LPH hereinafter) having a plurality of LED devices is used in the A0 wide machine, and also, because of other process conditions. As a result, an unauthorized copy protection pattern may not satisfy requirements prescribed in a required standard for unauthorized copy protection patterns. If the requirements of the standard are not met, the unauthorized copy protection pattern superposed by the first image processing apparatus may not be recognized by the second image processing apparatus. If the second image processing apparatus cannot recognize the unauthorized copy protection pattern, the second image processing apparatus problematically cannot be controlled to prevent itself from printing the unauthorized copy protection image. Thus, the second image processing apparatus can be problematically used to copy even such an unauthorized copy protection image. As a result, unauthorized copy protection cannot be achieved. The above-mentioned process conditions mean developing roller diameters, developing systems, toner ingredient diameters, and so forth. These conditions are different between the above-mentioned A0 wide machine which is provided for A0-size paper and another machine which is provided for A3-size paper or for smaller paper.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to solve the problem, after an unauthorized copy protection pattern is superposed on given image data, image data of the unauthorized copy protection pattern is corrected in pixel units, so that a size of an isolated dot included in the unauthorized copy protection pattern is controlled. After the image data of the unauthorized copy protection pattern is thus controlled, an image represented by the given image data and the image data of the unauthorized copy protection pattern is written on a photosensitive body.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, from image data (referred to as an entirety of image data hereinafter) in which image data of an unauthorized copy protection pattern is superposed on given image data, the unauthorized copy protection pattern is recognized. Then, the thus-recognized unauthorized copy protection pattern is corrected in pixel unit before the entirety of image data is actually printed. As a result, it is possible to control with high accuracy a size of an isolated dot included in the unauthorized copy protection pattern which is included in an image consequently printed. As a result, a first image processing apparatus can print an image including an unauthorized copy protection pattern, which has been thus controlled with high accuracy in a size of the isolated dot included therein. Then, when this image of printed matter is read by a second image processing apparatus having a function of preventing itself from printing an unauthorized copy protection image, the second image processing apparatus can positively recognize the unauthorized copy protection pattern included in the read image. Thus, unauthorized copy protection can be achieved, and the unauthorized copy protection function of the first image processing apparatus can work well.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">One idea to solve the above-mentioned problem is to control a size of an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern with the use of a so-called thinning function or such, for the purpose that the above-mentioned requirements of the standard for unauthorized copy protection patterns may be met. Actually, for a horizontal direction of an image, the above-mentioned thinning function may be effective. However, for a vertical direction, the thinning function may not be sufficiently effective. Therefore, it may not be possible that the requirements of the standard are met, by this method. Further, when control of image processing is made for the vertical direction of a given image, an influence may appear to the entirety of the image. Therefore, control of image processing for the vertical direction may not be effective. Further, a pixel diameter of each LED device of an LPH depends on generally-used components/parts. Thus, it may be difficult to change the pixel diameter of the LED device. Further, a change of the above-mentioned process conditions may have an adverse effect, and thus, it may not be possible to actually change the process conditions. Therefore, it may be actually difficult to change developing roller diameters, developing systems, toner ingredient diameters, and so forth, to achieve a dot diameter equivalent to a dot diameter obtained from another type of image forming apparatus provided for smaller-size paper, to meet the requirements of the standard.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an embodiment of the present invention, in an image writing part, line memories are used and a small image matrix (simply referred to as an image matrix) is extracted in sequence. By reading the thus-extracted image matrix, an unauthorized copy protection pattern is recognized if the image matrix includes an isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern. When the unauthorized copy protection pattern is thus recognized from the image matrix, a size of the entirety of a dot pattern of the isolated dot included in the unauthorized copy protection pattern is controlled as a result of a light emitting amount of a LED device is controlled for each pixel. Because an A0 photosensitive body has a wide width, process characteristics vary depending on a height on the photosensitive body. As a result, a dot diameter of a dot consequently formed on paper may vary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows an example of such a phenomenon. That is, a size of a dot may vary, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, among a left side, a center and a right side on the A0 photosensitive body.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In order to effectively control such a variation of a dot diameter even on an A0 photosensitive body for example, and to consequently improve an accuracy of recognizing an unauthorized copy protection pattern or a recognition rate, a first aspect of an embodiment has the following configuration. That is, an optical writing apparatus superposes an unauthorized copy protection pattern on given image data, and carries out optical writing on a photosensitive body with the use of a light emitting device array. A storing part is provided to store every n lines of the image data. A matrix generating part is provided to generate an image matrix of n&#xd7;n (n denotes an integer equal to or more than 2) with the use of the image data read from the storing part. A control part is provided to check image data of the image matrix generated by the matrix generating part to recognize the unauthorized copy protection pattern. The control part corrects the image data of the unauthorized copy protection pattern in pixel units when thus recognizing the unauthorized copy protection pattern. The control part thus controls a size of an isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern. Further, the control part divides a given image in a main scan direction, and controls a size of an isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern separately for each of the thus-obtained divided image areas.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a second aspect of an embodiment, in addition to the above-mentioned first aspect, a plurality of light emitting device arrays, each having a width shorter than a size of A0 paper to which an image written on the photosensitive body is transferred, are arranged as follows: That is, the light emitting device arrays overlap each other along the main scan direction. Optical writing is carried out for a writing width of an A0 size. The control part controls a size of an isolated dot included in the unauthorized copy protection pattern for an image area of a joint portion between adjacent ones of the light emitting device arrays separately from that of the other portions.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a third aspect of an embodiment, in addition to the above-mentioned second aspect, the control part controls a size of an isolated dot for each divided image area separately from another divided image area, obtained from dividing in the main scan direction a given image, other than the joint portions.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a ninth aspect of an embodiment, in addition to the above-mentioned seventh aspect, the adjusting part has a transfer rate control part configured to control a transfer rate of image data to a light emitting device corresponding to each pixel included in the isolated dot.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a tenth aspect of an embodiment, in addition to the above-mentioned seventh aspect, an output control part configured to control output of a light emitting device corresponding to each pixel included in the isolated dot, a transfer rate control part configured to control a transfer rate of image data to the light emitting device; and a selecting part configured to select either one of the output control part and the transfer rate control part, are provided. The selecting part selects either one of the output control part and the transfer rate control part depending on whether a binary mode or a multi-level mode is used. The adjusting is carried out with the use of one of the output control part and the transfer rate control part, selected by the selecting part.</p>

A pattern recognizing step is carried out to read the image matrix generated in the matrix generating step to recognize the unauthorized copy protection pattern. A control step is carried out, when thus recognizing the unauthorized copy protection pattern in the pattern recognizing step, to control a size of the entirety of an isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern by controlling a light amount of each light emitting device in pixel unit. Further, the control step divides a given image in a main scan direction, and controls a size of an isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern separately for each of the thus-obtained divided image areas.</p>

The control step corrects the image data of the unauthorized copy protection pattern in pixel units when thus recognizing the unauthorized copy protection pattern. The control step thus controls a size of an isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern. Further, the control step divides a given image in a main scan direction, and controls a size of an isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern separately for each of the thus-obtained divided image areas.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the CIS <b>101</b> converts the focused original image into an analog signal, which is then amplified by an image amplifying circuit <b>102</b>. An A/D converting circuit <b>103</b> converts the thus-amplified image signal into a multi-level digital image signal. The digital image signal is then output in synchronization with a clock signal output from a synchronization control circuit <b>106</b>. Then, digital image information represented by the digital image signal is processed by a shading correcting circuit <b>104</b>, whereby a distortion caused by a light variation amount in the LED device, sensitivity variation in the CIS <b>101</b>, and so forth, is corrected. The digital image information thus corrected by the shading correcting circuit <b>104</b> is converted into digital recording image information by means of an image processing circuit <b>105</b>, and then is written in an image memory part <b>301</b> provided in an image information storing part <b>300</b>. Further, a reading control circuit <b>107</b> controls a synchronization control circuit <b>106</b> and so forth included in the reading part <b>100</b>. A scanner driving circuit <b>108</b> drives and controls motors rotating the roller <b>21</b>, the white roller <b>23</b> and so forth included in the reading part <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The system control unit <b>302</b> controls the writing part <b>500</b> and the copy unit <b>200</b>, and controls a series of processes for writing an image on the photosensitive body according to the image information written in the image memory part <b>301</b>, and then, transferring the image to transfer paper. The writing part <b>500</b> carries out optical writing of an image in the copy unit <b>200</b>. In further detail, the system control unit <b>302</b> carries out overall control of the image forming apparatus. Thus, the system control unit <b>302</b> controls the reading control circuit <b>107</b>, the synchronization control circuit <b>106</b>, the image memory part <b>301</b>, the image converting part <b>501</b>, and the LPH control circuit <b>502</b>, which carry out image data transfer operations and image data processing operations. Further, the system control unit <b>302</b> controls the driving control circuit <b>505</b> which then in turn controls the scanner driving circuit <b>303</b> and the printer driving unit <b>303</b> which then in turn drives various motors so that the original and the transfer paper can be properly conveyed. An image delay memory <b>504</b> is a delay memory used when the LPH control circuit <b>502</b> carries out control operation. As mentioned above, the system control unit <b>302</b> has the CPU <b>302</b>-<b>1</b>. The CPU <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> executes a program written in the ROM <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> or the RAM <b>302</b>-<b>3</b>, which are computer readable information recording media, and are also included in the system control unit <b>302</b>. Thus, the CPU <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> carries out the above-mentioned control operation.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The control operation of the CPU <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> includes a control operation of controlling the image memory <b>301</b> and so forth to superpose an unauthorized copy protection pattern on given image data representing an image to be printed by means of the copy unit <b>200</b>. The control operation to superpose an unauthorized copy protection pattern is, for example, a control operation for performing operation to superpose an unauthorized copy protection pattern on image data as a copy preventing pattern by means of a secret numbering function which is a well-know art (see Japanese Patent No. 3078433, paragraph 0024). As a specific configuration example required for performing the operation to superpose an unauthorized copy protection pattern on image data, the above-mentioned well-known art can be used for example. Therefore, detailed description thereof is omitted. With the use of a register which can be externally set, for example, it may be set whether the operation to superpose an unauthorized copy protection pattern on image data is actually carried out. Further, the control operation of the CPU <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> includes a control operation, described later, to recognize an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection patter, and correct the isolated dot, which operation is actually carried out by an unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b> and so forth, described later, under the CPU <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> of the control of the system control unit <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The writing part <b>500</b> receives an image signal transferred with a synchronization clock signal in the image converting part <b>501</b>, and transfers it to the LPH control circuit <b>502</b> as it is. Alternatively, the image signal undergoes density conversion and then, is provided to the LPH control circuit <b>502</b>. The LPH control circuit <b>502</b> divides the received image signal into an image signal for the LPH<b>1</b> (<b>503</b>-<b>1</b>), an image signal for the LPH<b>2</b> (<b>503</b>-<b>2</b>), and an image signal for the LPH<b>3</b> (<b>503</b>-<b>3</b>). Further, the LPH control circuit <b>502</b> carries out image correction on image data represented by the received image signal. The LPH<b>1</b> through LPH<b>3</b> (<b>503</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>503</b>-<b>3</b>) convert the image data into infrared light, and output the infrared light. The image data thus converted into the infrared light and output is provided to the copy unit <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, a configuration of the copy unit <b>200</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. An electricity charging unit <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a charging unit called a scorotron charger, with a grid, for uniformly charging the drum shaped photosensitive body <b>25</b> acting as an image carrier at &#x2212;2500 V. The photosensitive body <b>25</b> is rotated by a motor not shown. The LPHs <b>503</b> are configured such that the LPH<b>1</b> through LPH<b>3</b> (<b>503</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>503</b>-<b>3</b>) are arranged along a main scan direction, and a plurality of LED devices are arranged in array shapes in the main scan direction. Based on image information provided by the LPH control circuit <b>502</b>, the LED devices of the LPH<b>1</b> through LPH<b>3</b> (<b>503</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>503</b>-<b>3</b>) emit light, and the light is then applied to the photosensitive body <b>25</b> via a SELFOC (registered trade name) lens array which is an optical device.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When the photosensitive body <b>25</b> is thus exposed to the light applied based on the digital image information from the LPH<b>1</b> through LPH<b>3</b>, a photoelectric phenomenon causes a charge on a surface thereof to flow to the ground. The LPH<b>1</b> through LPH<b>3</b> emit a large amount of light with the LED devices for a part at which an original is dark while the LPH<b>1</b> through LPH<b>3</b> emit a smaller amount of light for a part at which the original is light. By such a manner of control, an electrostatic latent image having image parts, corresponding to dark parts and light parts of the original, is formed on the photosensitive body <b>25</b>. The electrostatic latent image thus formed on the photosensitive body <b>25</b> is then developed by a developing unit <b>27</b>, into a toner image. The developing unit <b>27</b> is configured such that, in the inside, toner is stirred, so that the toner is charged negatively. There, &#x2212;700 V is applied as a bias. Thereby, the toner adheres only to a part to which light is thus applied.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Transfer paper acting as a sheet like recording medium is fed to a registration roller <b>31</b> selectively from three paper feeding tables <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>30</b> and a manual feeding part. The transfer paper is then fed in predetermined timing by means of the registration roller <b>31</b>, to pass below the photosensitive body <b>25</b>. At this time, a transfer charger <b>32</b> as a transfer means transfers the toner image formed on the photosensitive body <b>25</b> to the transfer paper. The transfer paper is then removed from the photosensitive body <b>25</b> by means of a removing charger <b>33</b>, and then, is fed to a fixing unit <b>35</b> by means of a conveying belt <b>34</b>. The toner on the transfer paper is fixed by means of the fixing unit <b>35</b>. The transfer paper is then ejected to the outside of the image forming apparatus by means of ejecting rollers <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a block diagram showing a flow of image data in the writing part <b>500</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the writing unit <b>500</b> includes the image converting part <b>501</b>, the LPH control part <b>502</b>, the LPH<b>1</b> through LPH<b>3</b> <b>503</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>503</b>-<b>3</b> (simply referred to as LPHs hereinafter) and an SDRAM <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The writing part <b>500</b> carries out data replacement in a data flow as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">1) First, from the image information storing part <b>301</b>, image data <b>301</b>-<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of even-numbered pixels (referred to as EVEN, hereinafter) and odd-numbered pixels (referred to as ODD, hereinafter) are provided simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">2) The thus-provided image data undergo image correction as is necessary in response to a result of pattern recognition (also referred to as pattern matching), in the image converting part <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">3) Next, the LPH control circuit <b>502</b> divides the image data (i.e., in this case, line data in the main scan direction) provided from the image converting part <b>501</b> and writes the thus-divided image data in three A-group SRAMs (<b>502</b>-<b>1</b>A) of an image data RAM part <b>502</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">4) Next, a line of image data thus written in the three A-group SRAMs <b>502</b>-<b>1</b>A is read simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">5) During the time when the image data are read from the A-group SRAMs <b>502</b>-<b>1</b>A, a second line of image data is written in three B-group SRAMs <b>502</b>-<b>1</b>B. That is, a so-called toggling operation is carried out. Selection of the SRAM groups <b>502</b>-<b>1</b> is carried out by an address control part <b>502</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">6) Image data, corresponding to the respective LPHs, thus read from the SRAMs <b>502</b>-<b>1</b> is once transferred to the SDRAM <b>504</b>, and then, is read again. The LPH<b>1</b> through LPH<b>3</b> <b>503</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>503</b>-<b>3</b> shift in a sub-scan direction according to a predetermined mechanical layout thereof. That is, the LPHs are disposed in a staggered manner (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref>, <b>22</b>). Therefore, the LPH<b>1</b> <b>503</b>-<b>1</b> is used as a benchmark, while, image data for the LPH<b>2</b> <b>503</b>-<b>2</b> and the LPH<b>3</b> <b>503</b>-<b>3</b> are read with a delay corresponding to the sift amount of the LPHs. Such a manner of reading is carried out by a delay control and LPH transfer part <b>502</b>-<b>3</b>. The image delay memory <b>504</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> corresponds to the SDRAM <b>504</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">7) Finally, the delay control and LPH transfer part <b>502</b>-<b>3</b> transfers image data to the LPH<b>1</b> through LPH<b>3</b> <b>503</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>503</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The image converting part <b>501</b> includes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a GATE control part <b>501</b>-<b>1</b>, a memory control part <b>501</b>-<b>2</b>, an image recognizing part (i.e., an unauthorized copy protection pattern recognizing part) <b>501</b>-<b>3</b>, and a main/sub trim processing part <b>501</b>-<b>5</b>. Respective density converting modes (i.e., image outputting modes) in the image converting part <b>501</b> may be set externally and freely with the use of a register dense_r [2:0]. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the respective density converting modes set by means of the register dense_r [2:0], and shows matrix sizes for the respective modes, described later. The density converting modes include a &#x2018;through mode&#x2019; in which no image processing is carried out (i.e., ordinary outputting mode), an &#x2018;equal density mode&#x2019;, a &#x2018;two-times density mode&#x2019;, a &#x2018;three-times density mode&#x2019;, and a &#x2018;1.5-times density mode&#x2019;.</p>

LSYNC provided by the image information storing part <b>300</b> is thinned in the modes in which image density is converted. Therefore, interpolation should be carried out before LSYNC is provided to the LPH control circuit <b>502</b>. The GATE control part <b>501</b>-<b>1</b> carries out a process for this purpose.

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A size of an image matrix used for each density converting mode (i.e., magnification) is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the above-mentioned equal density mode (also referred to as a printer output mode), or the above-mentioned through mode (also referred to as an ordinary image output mode), an image matrix generating part <b>501</b>-<b>22</b> of the memory control part <b>501</b>-<b>2</b> generates line groups used for a 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix. When an unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting function described below is set valid, the above-mentioned line groups are transferred to a next block, i.e., an unauthorized copy protection pattern part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b>. Otherwise, the line groups are provided to a density converting processing part <b>501</b>-<b>4</b>. In the 1.5-times density mode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, three different image matrixes (i.e., 2&#xd7;2, 6&#xd7;2 and 4&#xd7;3) are generated. After that, in each mode, a necessary image matrix is used. For the purpose of simplification of explanation, an image matrix used for unauthorized copy protection pattern correction is assumed simply to be a 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix, hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">A line memory control part (having functions of writing, reading and block switching) <b>501</b>-<b>23</b> carries out an operation of reading from and writing to the line memories <b>501</b>-<b>21</b>.

Line data is read from the other seven line memories, and thus, 7 lines of image data for being arranged in the sub-scan direction are provided for an image matrix. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show a detailed timing chart for the <b>1</b>s memory reading/writing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a block diagram showing details of the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b>. The unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b> reads an image matrix generating part register (i.e., hcopyset [1:0], which can be freely set externally), and determines whether the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting function is valid, and whether a binary mode or a multi-level mode is used. When it is determined that the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting function is valid, an unauthorized copy protection pattern superposed on image data is recognized. That is, first, an image matrix is generated with the use of image data of 1 through 7 lines obtained from the image matrix generating part <b>501</b>-<b>22</b>. Next, pattern recognition is carried out on the thus-obtained image matrix. When an unauthorized copy protection pattern is actually found out as a result of the above-mentioned pattern recognition, correction is carried out on the thus-found unauthorized copy protection pattern. Details of the correction will be described later, and an operation flow will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b> includes a delay part <b>501</b>-<b>31</b> including 7 lines each having three FFs, an image matrix generating part <b>501</b>-<b>32</b> to which data delayed by the delay part <b>501</b>-<b>31</b> are input, a pattern recognition and output image generating part <b>501</b>-<b>33</b> and a main scan counter <b>501</b>-<b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows settings in the image matrix generating part register (hcopyset [1:0]). Such a register (i.e., each register including in the image forming apparatus) is actually realized by the ROM <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> of the system control unit <b>302</b>, for example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a setting of &#x201c;1&#x201d; in the hcopyset [1:0] is for a case where the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting function is made invalid. A setting of &#x201c;2&#x201d; in the hcopyset [1:0] is for a case where the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting function is made valid, and also, the binary mode is used. A setting of &#x201c;3&#x201d; in the hcopyset [1:0] is for a case where the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting function is made valid and also the multi-level mode is used.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Details of generating a 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix are described now. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, image data for two pixels of EVEN and ODD output from the line memories <b>501</b>-<b>21</b> are latched by each FF of the delay part <b>501</b>-<b>31</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, &#x2018;first line once latched data&#x2019; means data obtained from first line data being once delayed. Similarly, &#x2018;first line twice latched data&#x2019; means data obtained from first line data being twice delayed. Similarly, &#x2018;first line thrice latched data&#x2019; means data obtained from first line data being thrice delayed. As a result, together with two pixels currently read, image data of total 8 pixels can be obtained. Because output of the line memories <b>501</b>-<b>21</b> is for eight lines, consequently it is possible to obtain image data of 7&#xd7;8 pixels simultaneously. In the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting function, the actual unauthorized copy protection pattern correction is carried out with the use of an image matrix of 7&#xd7;8 pixels thus generated by the image matrix generating part <b>501</b>-<b>32</b>. That is, two pixels of EVEN and ODD are processed in parallel, and also, a 7&#xd7;8 pixel image matrix is obtained as mentioned above. Then, from the 7&#xd7;8 pixel image matrix, a 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix is extracted having front 7 pixels (i.e., front 7 columns) in the main scan direction. Then, the thus-extracted 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix is used, and a center pixel thereof as a target pixel is corrected. After that, a shift is carried out on the 7&#xd7;8 pixel image matrix in the main scan direction for one pixel. Thereby, a next 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix is extracted having rear 7 pixels (i.e., rear 7 columns) in the main scan direction. Then, the thus-extracted 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix is used, and a center pixel thereof is corrected. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a timing chart for generating the above-mentioned 7&#xd7;8 pixel image matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Pattern recognition in the embodiment is carried out as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">First, a case where image division is performed in the main scan direction is described. A div_set [14:0] register (for example, realized by the RAM <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> of the system control unit <b>302</b>, which is freely set externally) shown in a lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is used to set a divided image area width, and the number of divisions. Assuming that the writing maximum width in the main scan direction is 21600 dots, and a value set in the div_set [14:0] is a divided image area width, the number of divisions is calculated as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>The number of divisions=21600/div_set [14.0]&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">That is, the number of divisions is set based on calculation of the above formula (1). When the calculation of the formula (1) is divisible, the number of the divisions is the quotient of the calculation. When the calculation is not divisible, the quotient is rounded up, and thus, the number of divisions is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an example of main scan image dividing. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the number of divisions is 5. In this embodiment, the maximum available number of divisions is 16.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Pattern recognition is carried out by the pattern recognizing and output image generating part <b>501</b>-<b>33</b> of the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b>. A total of 10 matching patterns (also referred to as reference pixel patterns), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, are used, for an image matrix generated by the image matrix generating part <b>32</b>. These matching patterns are previously set in registers inpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through inpat <b>1</b>-<b>49</b> [4:0] (for example, realized by the ROM <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> of the system control unit <b>302</b>, which can be freely set externally). The total <b>49</b> registers inpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> through inpat <b>1</b>-<b>49</b> correspond to respective ones of a total of 49 pixels of a 7&#xd7;7 pixel matrix generated by the image matrix generating part <b>501</b>-<b>32</b>, respectively (as shown in a lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). In the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix is shown. The 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix has matrix elements <b>1</b> through <b>49</b> as shown. These matrix elements correspond to respective pixels included in the image matrix. Respective pixel values corresponding to these pixels are set in the above-mentioned 49 registers inpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> through inpat <b>1</b>-<b>49</b>, respectively. The total 10 sets are prepared as mentioned above, and each set includes the 49 registers. As a result, the total 10 matting patterns are prepared. In these ten sets of registers, 10 possible dot patterns for an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern are set, respectively. Actually, these 10 possible dot patterns correspond to ten possible patterns which are different according to where a target pixel is located in the isolated dot. With the use of these dot patterns, pattern recognition is carried out on the given image data to find an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern, and then, the thus-found isolated dot is corrected. Thus, it is possible to particularly correct the unauthorized copy protection pattern, and it is not necessary to correct the entirety of an image represented by image data including the given image data.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Determination as to which one of the above-mentioned ten matching patterns matches a given imaged matrix is carried out by the pattern recognizing and output image generating part <b>501</b>-<b>33</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. After matching is obtained, a target pixel, i.e., a center pixel of the given image matrix, is corrected in such a manner that a corresponding pixel value according the matching result is used to replace the original one. The matching result means a result of the determination as to which one of the above-mentioned ten matching patterns matches the given imaged matrix. The main scan counter <b>501</b>-<b>34</b> carries out counting to determine at all times what number in the main scan direction the current target pixel corresponds to. As a result, it is possible to determine which one of the divided image areas (i.e., the divided areas shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) the target pixel belongs to. When the given 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix matches a matching pattern set in any one of the registers inpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through 1-49 [4:0], a pixel value of the target pixel is replaced by a pixel value based on a value of an appropriate one of output registers outpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through outpat <b>16</b>-<b>10</b> [4:0]. These output registers, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 16</figref>, are set to correspond to the above-mentioned 10 matching patterns, and also, correspond to the above-mentioned divided image areas (the maximum number of divisions being <b>16</b> as mentioned above). The output registers may be realized by the RAM <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> of the system control unit <b>302</b> and can be freely set externally. The total 160 (i.e., 16&#xd7;10=160) output registers outpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through outpat <b>16</b>-<b>10</b> [4:0] are prepared. For example, the first output register outpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> is used to set a pixel value for a corrected target pixel for when a target pixel belongs to the first one of the above-mentioned divided image areas, and the first one of the above-mentioned ten matching patterns matches the given 7&#xd7;7 pixels image matrix. Similarly, for example, the last 160th output register outpat <b>16</b>-<b>10</b> is used to set a pixel value for a corrected target pixel for when a target pixel belongs to the 16th one of the above-mentioned divided image areas, and the tenth one of the above-mentioned ten matching patterns matches the given 7&#xd7;7 pixels image matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Assuming that the multi-level mode is used, the pixel value thus obtained from the above-mentioned output register is used for a corrected target pixel, and is provided to the corresponding LPH. Assuming that the binary mode is used, a so-called pseudo multi-level mode method is used to obtain a corrected target pixel. The pseudo multi-level mode method is described now. A target pixel is written twice with shifting in the sub-scan direction. Such a manner will be referred to as &#x2018;sub-scan twice putting&#x2019; hereinafter. With the use of possible combinations of the thus-obtained total two pixel values (each having a binary value, i.e., 0 or 1), the number of gradations more than two directly obtained from the binary number system are available. Because the binary system has two values, 0 and 1, the number of the above-mentioned combinations is 2&#xd7;2=4. As a result, the total 4 values are available for a pixel value obtained from the sub-scan twice putting. Image data used in the image forming apparatus has such a data structure prepared for the multi-level mode. In the binary mode, only the lower two bits of the data structure are used to obtain the above-mentioned total 4 values for each pixel (i.e., 2 [bits]&#xd7;2 (of the binary system)=4).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a lower part, when a pixel value obtained from the above-mentioned output register is 00, writing is not carried out for two lines of the sub-scan twice putting. When a pixel value obtained from the above-mentioned output register is 01, writing is carried out only for the first line (i.e., a pixel value of the line is 1), and writing is not carried out (i.e., a pixel value of the line is 0) for the second line of the sub-scan twice putting. When a pixel value obtained from the above-mentioned output register is 10, writing is not carried out for the first line (i.e., a pixel value of the line is 0), and writing is carried out (i.e., a pixel value of the line is 1) for the second line of the sub-scan twice putting. When a pixel value obtained from the above-mentioned output register is 11, writing is carried out for each of the first and second lines (i.e., each of the respective pixel values of the lines is 1) of the sub-scan twice putting. Thus, in the binary mode, a corrected target pixel, corresponding to two pixels thus obtained from the sub-scan twice putting, to replace an original target pixel, is thus controlled. As a result, the target pixel included in an isolated dot of an unauthorized copy protection pattern is corrected, and thus, an unauthorized copy protection pattern is appropriately corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting operation in the embodiment. An upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the 1st through 7th lines arranged in the sub-scan direction extracted from an image represented by given image data, each line including 0th through 23rd pixels arranged in the main scan direction. In the figure, a black circle represents a black pixel (i.e., a pixel having a pixel value of 1, the same manner holding hereinafter), and a white circle represents a white pixel (i.e., a pixel having a pixel value of 0, the same manner holding hereinafter). In the figure, four collections of black pixels are shown, each collection having 3&#xd7;3 black pixels, arranged horizontally in the main scan direction. These black pixel collections correspond to respective isolated dots of an unauthorized copy protection pattern in the example. Such an unauthorized copy protection pattern may be a well-known tint block (for example, a copy preventing pattern shown in the above-mentioned Japanese Patent No. 3078433, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a state in which, from given image data, a first image matrix (corresponding to the above-mentioned 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix, the same manner holding hereinafter) of a range of 1st through 7th lines arranged in the sub-scan direction is extracted, each line including 0th through 6th pixels arranged in the main scan direction, including the first isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern. Then, the thus-obtained first image matrix matches any one of the above-mentioned total ten matching patterns in the above-mentioned pattern recognition. Further, from the given image data, a second image matrix of a range of 1st through 7th lines arranged in the sub-scan direction is extracted, each line including 7th through 13th pixels arranged in the main scan direction, including the second isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern. Then, the thus-obtained second image matrix matches another one of the above-mentioned total ten matching patterns in the above-mentioned pattern recognition. Further, from the given image data, a third image matrix of a range of 1st through 7th lines arranged in the sub-scan direction is extracted, each line including 14th through 20th pixels arranged in the main scan direction, including the third isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern. Then, the thus-obtained third image matrix matches further another one of the above-mentioned total ten matching patterns in the above-mentioned pattern recognition. Further, from the given image data, a fourth image matrix of a range of 1st through 7th lines arranged in the sub-scan direction is extracted, each line including 21st through 27th pixels arranged in the main scan direction, including the fourth isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern. Then, the thus-obtained fourth image matrix matches further another one of the above-mentioned total ten matching patterns in the above-mentioned pattern recognition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a state, for the purpose of convenience of explanation, when the above-mentioned four times of matching occur simultaneously. However, actually in the pattern recognition, the image matrixes are extracted one by one in sequence, and a comparison is made each time with the matching patterns (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>). Therefore, the above-mentioned four times of matching actually occur one by one in sequence and not simultaneously in the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, only a target pixel, included in an isolated dot, is corrected. Thus, correction of an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pastern is carried out in pixel units. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the target pixel corresponds to a pixel located precisely at a center of 7&#xd7;7 pixels included in an image matrix. In the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, &#x201c;T&#x201d; is given to each target pixel (the same manner holding hereinafter). In an example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, correction of an isolated dot of an unauthorized copy protection pattern is carried out in such a manner that a pixel located in the periphery of the isolated dot is apparently changed in its gradation. In such a manner of correction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref> described later, the size of the isolated dot included in the unauthorized copy protection pattern is apparently reduced, so that the isolated dot can satisfy the above-mentioned standard for unauthorized copy protection patterns, and thus, the corresponding unauthorized copy protection pattern can be positively recognized by a second image processing apparatus. Thereby unauthorized copy protection function can actually work well. Specifically, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a target pixel of the above-mentioned first isolated dot, located in the 4th line in the sub-scan direction and at the 3rd pixel in the main scan direction, is a peripheral pixel of the first isolated dot. As mentioned above, the peripheral pixel of the isolated dot should be reduced in its gradation to apparently reduce the size of the corresponding isolated dot. Actually, as shown in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, for the corresponding pixel, a second line is not written (i.e., a white pixel occurs there) in the sub-scan twice putting to apparently reduce the gradation of the target pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> show respective cases of the binary mode and the multi-level mode. In these figures, as the above-mentioned matching pattern, in binary mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, &#x201c;1&#x201d; is set in each of the above-mentioned registers inpat <b>1</b>-<b>25</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>27</b>, inpat <b>1</b>-<b>32</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>34</b>, and inpat <b>1</b>-<b>32</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>41</b>, while &#x201c;0&#x201d; is set in each of the other registers. Correspondingly, in the thus obtained matching pattern, as shown in an upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, in a 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix, 25th through 27th, 32nd through 34th, and 39th through 41st (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, lower part), are black pixels, while the other pixels are white pixels. Further, in this example, it is assumed that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, upper part, in an image matrix extracted from given image data, an isolated dot occurs having 3&#xd7;3 black pixels in a range of 4th through 6th in the sub-scan direction and 3rd through 5th in the main scan direction. As a result, the image matrix extracted from the given image data is matched by the above-mentioned matching patterns. That is, when the image matrix extracted from the given image data is of a range of 0th through 7th in the sub-scan direction and 0th through 6th in the main scan direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, upper part, the image matrix is matched by the above-mentioned matching pattern. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, lower part, a target pixel of the image matrix, i.e., a pixel of 4th line in the sub-scan direction and 3rd in the main scan direction, is corrected. The same manner holds in a case of FIG. <b>19</b>. However, in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, because the multi-level mode is used, &#x201c;1f&#x201d; is set in each of the above-mentioned registers inpat <b>1</b>-<b>25</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>27</b>, inpat <b>1</b>-<b>32</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>34</b>, and inpat <b>1</b>-<b>32</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>41</b>, while &#x201c;0&#x201d; is set in each of the other registers. As the above-mentioned output registers for setting a pixel value of a corrected target pixel, one thereof is selected corresponding to a divided image area to which the corresponding target pixel belongs. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, in the embodiment, pattern recognition is carried out with the use of an image matrix extracted from given image data, as well as previously provided matching patterns for an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern. Thereby, the isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern is found from image data in which the unauthorized copy protection pattern has been superposed on given image data, and a pixel included in the isolated dot is corrected to control the size of the isolated dot. Thus, it is possible to control only the unauthorized copy protection pattern superposed on the given image data without influencing an image represented by the given image data. Thus, it is possible to effectively control an unauthorized copy protection pattern superposed on given image data, and thus, it is possible that the unauthorized copy protection function positively works well.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The density converting processing part <b>501</b>-<b>4</b> subsequent to the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b> includes, although not shown, a smoothing processing part, a 1.5-times density converting processing part, an image selector, and a format converting part. The density converting processing part <b>503</b>-<b>4</b> selects any density converting mode according to the given setting mentioned above, and carries out a corresponding process on given image data. That is, when the through mode is selected, the given image data is simply made pass through. A corresponding density converting process is carried out on given image data when any one of the respective equal density, 1.5-times density, two-times density, and three-times density modes.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The main/sub-scan trim part <b>501</b>-<b>5</b> subsequent to the density converting processing part <b>501</b>-<b>4</b> carries out masking processing on given image data. Specific masking amounts for given image data in the main/sub-scan directions are determined according to given set values set in predetermined registers. The masking processing means a process for which corresponding image data are set to be &#x201c;0&#x201d;, for the purpose that nothing should be printed in page margins of top, bottom, left and right ends of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The embodiment 1 described above has the following advantages:</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">1) A given image is divided in the main scan direction, and an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern is corrected separately depending on each of the thus-divided image areas. As a result, it is possible to carry out the correction in such a manner that variations in dot sizes caused by a position along the photosensitive body can be effectively reduced. Thereby, it is possible to improve a recognition rate when an unauthorized copy protection pattern superposed on given image data is recognized from an output image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows a case where these variations are reduced. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the variations in dot sizes are corrected, depending on a position along a longitudinal direction of the A0-width photosensitive body as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. Thus, the dot sizes are made equal to each other throughout the entire length of the photosensitive body, as a result of correction of pixels of an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern being carried out in a manner depending on each particular divided image area.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">2) A width of each divided image area when a given image is divided in the main scan direction can be freely set externally. Therefore, it is possible to finely carry out correction of dot size variations caused depending on a position along the photosensitive body. Thereby, it is possible to improve the recognition rate when an unauthorized copy protection pattern is recognized from an output image.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">3) The number of divisions when a given image is divided in the main scan direction can be freely set externally. Therefore, it is possible to finely carry out correction of dot size variations caused depending on a position along the photosensitive body. Thereby, it is possible to improve the recognition rate when an unauthorized copy protection pattern is recognized from an output image.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">4) The matching patterns used when pattern recognition is carried out with the use of an image matrix generated with the use of the line memories can be freely externally set. The matching patterns are used in the pattern recognition for determining whether a given image matrix includes an isolated dot of an unauthorized copy protection pattern, and also for determining a specific manner of correction depending on a position of a target pixel in the isolated dot by determining where the target pixel is located in the isolated dot. Further, it is possible to carry out unauthorized copy protection pattern correction whether the binary mode or the multi-level mode is used. As a result, it is possible to respond to a case where a dot pattern of an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern to be superposed on given image data is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">5) Set values in the output registers used for determining how to correct pixels of an isolated dot of an unauthorized copy protection pattern can be freely set externally. As a result, it is possible to externally adjust how to correct each pixel of the isolated dot included in the unauthorized copy protection pattern. As a further result, it is possible to carry out unauthorized copy protection pattern correction in consideration of possible variations among machines, a possible change in a dot shape due to a change in environment, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">6) When the image forming apparatus operates in the multi-level mode and has multi-level LPHs, a size of an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern can be controlled as a result of LED devices corresponding to respective pixels included in the isolated dot being controlled in their light emitting amounts.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">7) When the image forming apparatus operates in the binary mode and has binary LPHs, the following method may be used. That is, it is assumed that, in an ordinary state, image data is transferred at a predetermined transfer rate x to the LPHs. Then, image data is transferred at m-times of the predetermined transfer rate x, where m denotes a positive integer. As a result, each pixel can be written m times with positions of writing being gradually shifted in the sub-scan direction. Thus, the above-mentioned pseudo multi-level mode method is used. As a result, it is possible to write a pixel in a pseudo multi-level mode method. By using the pseudo multi-level mode method, it is possible to control a size of an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">8) It is possible to select a method used for unauthorized copy protection pattern correction, depending on whether the binary mode or the multi-level mode is used. As a result, it is possible to carry out unauthorized copy protection pattern correction in an appropriate manner whether the binary mode or the multi-level mode is used. As a result, it is possible to share a common unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting function among different types of machines of image forming apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">An image forming apparatus in an embodiment 2 will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The embodiment 2 is almost the same as the above-described embodiment 1, and thus, differences therebetween will be described. In the embodiment 2, a plurality of LPHs are connected to carry out writing on a photosensitive body for A0-size paper, and variations in dot sizes caused in portions at which adjacent LPHs are connected. Such portions at which the adjacent LPHs are connected are referred to as joint portions. The embodiment 2 has a configuration to avoid a possible degradation in the recognition rate occurring due to the above-mentioned variations in dot sizes in joint portions.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a block diagram of details of an unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b> in the embodiment 2. In the embodiment 2, different from the embodiment 1, an area recognizing part <b>501</b>-<b>36</b> is provided between the pattern recognizing and output image generating part <b>501</b>-<b>33</b> and the main scan counter <b>501</b>-<b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, pattern recognition is carried out in the embodiment 2 as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">First, in control of dividing a given image in the main scan direction, the number of divided image areas assigned to each LPH is set in a div_set [2:0] register (for example, realized by the RAM <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> of the system control unit <b>302</b>, which can be freely set externally) shown in a lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Assuming that a range assigned to each LPH of LPHs <b>501</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> is 7680 dots as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, an area assigned to each LPH is divided every number of pixels obtained from 7680/div_set [2:0]. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows an example of division in which div_set [2:0]=4.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, consequently, a given image includes respective divided areas assigned to the LPH<b>1</b>, respective divided areas assigned to the LPH<b>2</b>, respective divided areas assigned to the LPH<b>3</b>, a left joint area (area <b>13</b>) and a right joint area (area <b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The area recognizing part <b>501</b>-<b>36</b> of the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b> recognizes the above-mentioned joint areas and respective divided image areas as follows: that is, every number of pixels obtained from 7680/div_set [2:0], an area of each one of the LPH<b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> (<b>503</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>) is recognized from the value of the main scan counter <b>501</b>-<b>34</b>, and thus, is divided. As to a last portion of each of the LPH<b>1</b> <b>503</b>-<b>1</b> and LPH<b>2</b> <b>503</b>-<b>2</b>, each joint portion is recognized with reading a designated corresponding address &#x201c;tunagiL [15:0]&#x201d; and &#x201c;tunagiR [15:0] (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, lower part). Consequently, each one of the respective divided image areas (areas <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>) assigned to the LPH<b>1</b>, the respective divided image areas (areas <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>) assigned to the LPH<b>2</b>, the respective divided image areas (areas <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>) assigned to the LPH<b>3</b>, the left joint area <b>13</b> and the right joint area <b>14</b>, are recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Further, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, further details are described now for the joint areas. In the embodiment 2, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a total of four pixels are recognized as left joint pixels, including a pixel indicated by the register tunagiL [15:0] and subsequent 3 pixels. A total of four pixels are recognized as right joint pixels, including a pixel indicated by the register tunagiR [15:0] and antecedent 3 pixels. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, in the embodiment 2, an area including the left joint pixels and also two pixels each antecedent and subsequent thereto (total 8=4+2+2) is recognized as the left joint area. Similarly, an area including the right joint pixels and further two pixels each antecedent and subsequent thereto is (total 8=4+2+2) recognized as the right joint area.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, ovals filled with halftone dots represent the left joint pixels or right joint pixels. Pattern <b>1</b> shows a state in which, in an image matrix, two columns of the joint pixels are included at a right end part. Similarly, pattern <b>2</b> shows a state in which, in an image matrix, three columns of the joint pixels are included at a right end part. That is, the pattern <b>2</b> shows a state in which a range of image data extracted as the image matrix is shifted in the main scan direction for one pixel with respect to the pattern <b>1</b>. Similarly, patterns <b>3</b> through <b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> show a state in which, a range of image data extracted as an image matrix is shifted in the main scan direction for one pixel each in sequence. That is, the patterns <b>1</b> through <b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> show a state in which, from the state in which a target pixel is located in front of the four columns of joint pixels by two pixels (pattern <b>1</b>), then, the target pixel passes through the four columns of joint pixels (patterns <b>3</b> through <b>6</b>), and, after that, the target pixel has left and goes away from the four columns of joint pixels by second pixels (pattern <b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the embodiment 2, pattern recognition is carried out as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">First, description is made for the divided image areas other than the joint areas. In pattern recognition, the ten matching patterns set by the registers inpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through inpat <b>1</b>-<b>49</b> [4:0] shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> are used for a given image matrix, as in the embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As mentioned above, these registers inpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through inpat <b>1</b>-<b>49</b> [4:0] correspond to respective pixels (1 through 49) of an image matrix extracted from image data for a page of an image. In the registers, possible ten patterns of an isolated dot of an unauthorized copy protection pattern are set, in each of which ten patterns, a target pixel is located at the center as mentioned above. With the use of the matching patterns, it is possible to correct only the unauthorized copy protection pattern without influencing a given image on which the unauthorized copy protection pattern is superposed.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">A determination as to whether the image matrix matches any one of the matching patterns is carried out by a pattern recognizing and output image generating part <b>501</b>-<b>32</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. From the pattern recognizing and output image generating part <b>501</b>-<b>32</b>, a corrected pixel value according to which of the matching patterns the image matrix has matched is output. That is, image data in which a size of the isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern has been corrected are output instead of the original image data. Such replacement of image data may also be referred to as image data conversion. During image data conversion, a main scan counter <b>501</b>-<b>34</b> counts the number of pixels to recognize a target pixel. Thereby, a divided image area to which the target pixel belongs is recognized by the area recognizing part <b>501</b>-<b>36</b>. Then, when a 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix in which the target pixel is located at the center as mentioned above agrees with any one of the matching patterns set in the registers input <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through inpat <b>1</b>-<b>49</b> [4:0], a corrected value of the target pixel is output based on a corresponding one of the output registers outpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through outpat <b>16</b>-<b>10</b> [4:0] shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-16</figref>. The output registers outpat <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through outpat <b>16</b>-<b>10</b> [4:0] are set separately for each one of the divided image areas, and also, are set separately for each one of the matching patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">When the multi-level mode is used, the thus-provided corrected value of the target pixel is converted into a corresponding gradation value, and is transferred to a corresponding LPH. When the binary mode is used, the above-mentioned pseudo multi-level mode method is used, in which sub-scan twice putting is carried out to write a target pixel twice in the sub-scan direction. In this case, image data may have a maximum of 4 values. Image data has a data structure having a large number of bits for preparing for the multi-level mode. In the binary mode, the lowest two bits thereof are used.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Specifically in the binary mode, according to the pseudo multi-level mode method, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, lower part, when a pixel value obtained from the above-mentioned output register is 00, writing is not carried out for two lines of the sub-scan twice putting. When a pixel value obtained from the above-mentioned output register is 01, writing is carried out only for the first line (i.e., a pixel value of the line is 1), and writing is not carried out (i.e., a pixel value of the line is 0) for the second line of the sub-scan twice putting. When a pixel value obtained from the above-mentioned output register is 10, writing is not carried out for the first line (i.e., a pixel value of the line is 0), and writing is carried out (i.e., a pixel value of the line is 1) for the second line of the sub-scan twice putting. When a pixel value obtained from the above-mentioned output register is 11, writing is carried out for each of the first and second lines (i.e., each of the respective pixel values of the lines is 1) of the sub-scan twice putting. Thus, in the binary mode, a corrected target pixel is controlled, corresponding to two pixels thus obtained from the sub-scan twice putting, to replace an original target pixel. As a result, the target pixel included in an isolated dot of an unauthorized copy protection pattern is corrected, and thus, the unauthorized copy protection pattern is appropriately corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Next, pattern recognition for the joint areas is described. In the embodiment 2, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the three LPHs <b>503</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>503</b>-<b>3</b> are arranged in a staggered manner. Therefore, when light emitting of the LPH<b>2</b> is controlled, correction is carried out for the joint areas between the LPH<b>1</b> and LPH<b>2</b>, and also, between LPH<b>2</b> and LPH<b>3</b>. First, description is made for the left joint area (area <b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Pattern recognition of the left joint area is carried out as follows: First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, there are a possible 8 patterns (patterns <b>1</b> through <b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>) from a state (pattern <b>1</b>) in which a target pixel first enters the left joint area (total 8 [columns]=4 (joint pixels)+2 (antecedent)+2 (subsequent) as mentioned above) through a state (pattern <b>8</b>) in which the target pixel is going to exit the left joint area. The 8 patterns <b>1</b> through <b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> are different according to where the above-mentioned 4 columns of left joint pixels are located in a 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix. For each of the 8 patterns, settings of the corresponding output registers are carried out separately. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref>, the settings of the corresponding output registers are carried out separately for the one of the ten matching patterns a given image matrix matches and also, separately for the one of the above-mentioned 8 patterns the left joint area is located in the given image matrix. Accordingly, the settings of the corresponding output registers, i.e., settings for a corrected value of a target pixel is a total of 80(=10&#xd7;8). These 80 settings correspond to respective 80 output registers outpat L<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through outpat L<b>8</b>-<b>10</b> [4:0] shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A</figref>, <b>24</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The right joint area (area <b>14</b>) has the same situation as that of the left joint area (area <b>13</b>) described above. That is, the settings of the corresponding output registers are carried out separately for the one of the ten matching patterns a given image matrix matches and also, separately for the one of the above-mentioned 8 patterns the right joint area is located in the given image matrix. Accordingly, the settings of the corresponding output registers, i.e., settings for a corrected value of a target pixel is a total of 80(=10&#xd7;8). These 80 settings correspond to respective 80 output registers outpat R<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> [4:0] through outpat R<b>8</b>-<b>10</b> [4:0] shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A</figref>, <b>25</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Further, as to unauthorized copy protection pattern correction for the left and right joint areas in the embodiment 2, separately from unauthorized copy protection pattern correction for the entirety of a given image, registers hcopyLset and hcopyRset are provided (which may be realized by the RAM <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> of the system control unit <b>302</b>, and may be freely set externally). With the use of these registers, it is possible to select whether unauthorized copy protection pattern correction is carried out, and whether the binary mode or the multi-level mode is used.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Differences between the binary mode and the multi-level modes in an unauthorized copy protection pattern correction method are the same as those described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>. That is, in the binary mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, &#x201c;1&#x201d; is set in each of the above-mentioned registers inpat <b>1</b>-<b>25</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>27</b>, inpat <b>1</b>-<b>32</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>34</b>, and inpat <b>1</b>-<b>32</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>41</b>, while &#x201c;0&#x201d; is set in each of the other registers. In the thus obtained matching pattern, as shown in an upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, in a 7&#xd7;7 pixel image matrix, 25th through 27th, 32nd through 34th, 39th through 41st (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, lower part) are black pixels, while the other pixels are white pixels. The same manner holds in a case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. However, in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, because the multi-level mode is used, &#x201c;1f&#x201d; is set in each of the above-mentioned registers inpat <b>1</b>-<b>25</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>27</b>, inpat <b>1</b>-<b>32</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>34</b>, and inpat <b>1</b>-<b>32</b> through <b>1</b>-<b>41</b>, while &#x201c;0&#x201d; is set in each of the other registers. Settings in the output registers are carried out separately for the one of the divided image areas (including the respective divided image areas assigned to the LPH<b>1</b> through LPH<b>3</b>, the left joint area and the right joint area) a target pixel belongs to.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Thus, in the embodiment 2 described above, it is possible to control only an unauthorized copy protection pattern superposed on given image data without influencing an image represented by the given image data. Thus, it is possible to effectively control an unauthorized copy protection pattern superposed on given image data, and thus, it is possible that the unauthorized copy protection function positively works well.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">According to the embodiment 2, in addition to those of the embodiment 1 described above, the following advantages are provided:</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">1) When an unauthorized copy protection pattern is superposed on given image data, an A0-size image is divided into divided image areas in consideration of an influence from a position along the photosensitive body and variations in the LPHs. Then, a light emitting amount used for writing each pixel on the photosensitive body is controlled in a separate manner according to which one of the divided image area a target pixel belongs to. Thereby, it is possible to stably print pixels in which a dot diameter of an isolated dot of the unauthorized copy protection pattern is stabilized at any position of the A0 width. Thus, it is possible to improve a recognition rate when the unauthorized copy protection pattern is recognized from an image printed on a printed matter in which the unauthorized copy protection pattern has been superposed on the given image data.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">2) When an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern is written on the photosensitive body in the joint areas between the adjacent LPHs, unauthorized copy protection pattern correction is carried out in a manner separate from unauthorized copy protection pattern correction carried out on the other areas. As a result, it is possible to adjust a dot diameter of an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern in the joint areas in a manner separate from unauthorized copy protection pattern correction carried out on the other areas.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">3) For an image area designated to each LPH other than the joint areas, the image area is divided in the main scan direction, and unauthorized copy protection pattern correction is carried out in a manner different for each of the respective divided image areas. As a result, it is possible to adjust dot diameters of isolated dots of unauthorized copy protection patterns separately for each one of the divided image areas. These functions are advantageous in particular when an A0-size image is printed.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows a flow chart illustrating a flow of operation of unauthorized copy protection pattern correction which is carried out by the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b> in the embodiment 1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and so forth, or by the unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b> in the embodiment 2 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, in step S<b>1</b>, the image matrix generating part <b>501</b>-<b>32</b> generates an image matrix with the use of image data provided by the line memories <b>501</b>-<b>21</b>. In step S<b>1</b>, the image matrix is extracted such that a target pixel is located at the center of the image matrix. In step S<b>2</b>, the pattern recognizing and output image generating part <b>501</b>-<b>33</b> uses the matching patterns set in the registers, and carries out pattern recognition. When any matching pattern matches the image matrix (YES in step S<b>2</b>), a pixel value of the target pixel is replaced by a corrected value, according to which matching pattern has matched to the image matrix, and which one of the divided image areas and the joint areas the target pixel belongs to. After that, step S<b>4</b> is carried out. It is noted that, when none of the matching patterns has matched the image matrix (NO in step S<b>2</b>), step S<b>3</b> is skipped and step S<b>4</b> is carried out directly.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In step S<b>4</b>, it is determined whether the target pixel is the last one on a line which the target pixel belongs to. When the target pixel is the last one on the line which the target pixel belongs to (YES in step S<b>4</b>), it is determined in step S<b>6</b> whether the target pixel belongs to the last line. When the target pixel belongs to the last line, the processing is finished.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">When the target pixel is not the last pixel on the line (NO in step S<b>4</b>), a next pixel is extracted to be a next target pixel, which is the pixel shifted in the main scan direction by one pixel in step S<b>5</b>. After that, for the thus-extracted new target pixel, the above-mentioned processes starting from step S<b>1</b> are carried out. When the target pixel does not belong to the last line (NO in step S<b>6</b>), a first pixel on a next line which is a line shifted in the sub-scan direction by one line is extracted to be a next target pixel in step S<b>7</b>. After that, for the thus-extracted new target pixel, the above-mentioned processes starting from step S<b>1</b> are carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Thus, in the embodiment 1 or 2 of the present invention, an image matrix is extracted, such that a target pixel is located at the center of the image matrix, in sequence. Thereby, the entirety of a page image currently being processed is scanned in the main scan direction and also in the sub-scan direction (steps S<b>5</b>, S<b>7</b>). Then, with the use of the image matrix thus extracted, pattern recognition is carried out (step S<b>2</b>). Thereby, an unauthorized copy protection pattern which is superposed on given image data is detected. Correction is then carried out on the thus-detected unauthorized copy protection pattern in pixel units (step S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref> illustrate an example of such correction of an isolated dot of an unauthorized copy protection pattern. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> illustrates a case where the binary mode is used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>a</i>) shows a state in which an isolated dot is printed. The isolated dot is formed by a 3 pixels by 3 pixels, that is, a 3&#xd7;3 pixel dot, as shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>b</i>) shows a case where the thus-printed isolated dot satisfies a required standard for unauthorized copy protection patterns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>c</i>) shows a case where the thus-printed isolated dot has a size too large to satisfy the required standard for unauthorized copy protection patterns. It is noted that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>b</i>) or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>c</i>), different from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>a</i>), the 3&#xd7;3 pixel isolated dot is expressed as a circle or an oval. This is because an expressing manner which is convenient for explanation is used (the same manner holding hereinafter).</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>d</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>e</i>) illustrate a state in which, in comparison to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>a</i>), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>b</i>), the above-mentioned unauthorized copy protection pattern correcting part <b>501</b>-<b>3</b> has carried out correction. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>d</i>) shows a state in which the above-mentioned pseudo multi-level mode method is used, and thus, each pixel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>a</i>) is written twice in the sub-scan direction, i.e., the above-mentioned sub-scan twice putting is carried out. Specifically, for example, a top-left pixel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>a</i>) is expressed by two pixels arranged in the sub-scan direction (i.e., the vertical direction on the paper), where the two pixels are corrected to be white pixels, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>d</i>). Similarly, a top-center pixel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>a</i>) is expressed by two pixels arranged in the sub-scan direction, where the two pixels are corrected to one white pixel and one black pixel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>d</i>). Thus, in the correction, all 9 pixels of the original 3&#xd7;3 pixel isolated dot are converted into a total of 18 pixels through the above-mentioned sub-scan twice putting. Also, peripheral pixels are corrected to include white pixels, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>d</i>). As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>e</i>), the isolated dot is apparently reduced in its size. Thus, the isolated dot included in the unauthorized copy protection pattern is adjusted to satisfy the required standard for unauthorized copy protection patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> shows an example of correction of an isolated dot included in an unauthorized copy protection pattern in a case where the multi-level mode is used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> except that whether the multi-level mode or the binary mode is used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>29</b>(<i>b</i>), <b>29</b>(<i>c</i>) and <b>29</b>(<i>e</i>) correspond to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>30</b>(<i>b</i>), <b>30</b>(<i>c</i>) and <b>30</b>(<i>e</i>), respectively. Duplicate description will be omitted. It is noted that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>d</i>), the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>d</i>), the above-mentioned pseudo multi-level mode is used also in this case, through the sub-scan twice putting. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>d</i>), an original 3&#xd7;3 pixel isolated dot shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>a</i>) is converted into a 3&#xd7;6 pixel dot including total 18 pixels. Because the multi-level mode is used, each of the 18 pixels is controlled in its gradation. Specifically, for example, a top-left pixel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>a</i>) is expressed by two pixels arranged in the sub-scan direction, where the two pixels are corrected to one white pixel and one gray pixel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>d</i>). Similarly, a top-center pixel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>a</i>) is expressed by two pixels arranged in the sub-scan direction, where the two pixels are corrected to one white pixel and one gray pixel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>d</i>). Thus, in the correction, all 9 pixels of the original 3&#xd7;3 pixel isolated dot are converted into a total of 18 pixels through the above-mentioned sub-scan twice putting, and also, peripheral pixels are corrected to include white and gray pixels, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>d</i>). As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(</figref><i>e</i>), the isolated dot is apparently reduced in its size. Thus, the isolated dot included in the unauthorized copy protection pattern is adjusted to satisfy the required standard for unauthorized copy protection patterns. It is noted that the gray pixel means a pixel having a gradation intermediate between those of a black pixel and a white pixel.</p>

(2000)). An array can comprise a low-density number of addressable locations (e.g. 2 to about 12), medium-density (e.g. about a hundred to one thousand addressable locations), or a high-density number (e.g. more than one thousand addressable locations/spots). Typically, the array format can be a geometrically-regular shape (e.g. a square, rectangle or circle) that allows for fabrication, handling, placement, stacking, reagent introduction, detection, and/or storage. The array may be configured in a row and column format, with or without regular spacing between each location. The locations may be bundled, mixed, or homogeneously blended for equalized treatment or sampling. An array may comprise a plurality of addressable locations configured so that each location is spatially addressable for high-throughput handling, robotic delivery, masking, or sampling of reagent(s), or for detection means including scanning by laser illumination and confocal or deflective light gathering.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, &#x201c;a plurality of the same or different markers&#x201d; refers to two or more of the same or different compositions being used as markers. Each composition (e.g. ligand) being used as a marker may comprise one or a plurality of detectable moieties. The compositions may be used individually or as mixtures for purposes of marking the cells. For example, the plurality of markers can be copies of the same labeled hybridization ligand (e.g. with each ligand comprising the same detectable moiety or moieties) bound to different (but identical or substantially identical) rRNA molecules in a cell to thereby, in the aggregate, render the cell detectable. In some embodiments, the plurality of markers can be different hybridization ligands (e.g. with each ligand comprising the same detectable moiety or moieties) wherein said different ligands bind to the same or different rRNA molecules in a cell to thereby, in the aggregate, render the cell detectable. In some embodiments, the plurality of markers may be the same hybridization ligand wherein at least two of the ligands comprise a different detectable moiety and wherein said ligands bind to different (but identical or substantially identical) rRNA molecules in a cell to thereby, in the aggregate, render the cell detectable. In some embodiments, the plurality of markers may be different hybridization ligands wherein each different ligand comprises a different detectable moiety or moieties and wherein said different ligands bind to the same or different rRNA molecules in a cell to thereby, in the aggregate, render the cell detectable.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, &#x201c;capable of binding to a target&#x201d;, &#x201c;capable of binding to the target&#x201d; &#x201c;capable of binding to a target analyte&#x201d;, &#x201c;capable of binding to the target analyte&#x201d;, &#x201c;capable of binding to an analyte&#x201d; or &#x201c;capable of binding to the analyte&#x201d; are essentially interchangeable and refer to having the ability to bind to selectively (i.e. specifically bind) bind to the target (target analyte or analyte) under conditions suitable for formation of a probe/target complex wherein the probe is the probe of a cell-linker-probe complex (See for example&#x2014;<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, &#x201c;cell&#x201d; refers to the basic organizational unit of all living organisms. A cell can be a bacteria, a yeast or can be a single cell of the tissue of a multicellular organism such as an animal, plant or human.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, &#x201c;chimera&#x201d; refers to an oligomer comprising subunits of two or more different classes of subunits. For example, a chimera can comprise subunits of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and locked nucleic acid (LNA), can comprise subunits of DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA), can comprise subunits of DNA and peptide nucleic acid (PNA), can comprise subunits of DNA, LNA and PNA or can comprise subunits of RNA and LNA, etc. It is to be understood that what the literature refers to as LNA oligomers (or probes) are typically chimeras (according to this definition), since said &#x201c;LNA oligomers&#x201d; usually incorporate only one or a few LNA nucleotides. The remaining nucleotides of a LNA oligomer are (as described in various literature references) typically standard DNA or RNA nucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, &#x201c;detectable moiety or moieties&#x201d; refers to a structural unit (or structural units as the case may be) of a composition (e.g. a hybridization ligand) that renders the composition detectable by instrument and/or method. Non-limiting examples of detectable moieties include fluorophores, chromophores, enzymes, haptens, radioisotopes, quantum dots and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. In some embodiments, two or more of the foregoing can be used in combination to render the composition detectable or independently (uniquely) detectable.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, &#x201c;determining&#x201d; or &#x201c;determination&#x201d; refers to making a decision based on investigation, reasoning and/or calculation. Some examples of determining include detecting, identifying, locating and/or quantifying cells as appropriate based on the usage of the term herein.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, &#x201c;in the aggregate&#x201d; refers to considering relevant subject matter as a whole rather than piecemeal.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, &#x201c;labeled hybridization ligands that bind to rRNA&#x201d; refers to a ligand or ligands that specifically (as compared to non-specifically) hybridize (under suitable hybridization conditions) to rRNA and that comprise one or more detectable moieties wherein said ligands can be used as markers to stain cells. The ligands can be oligomers of nucleic acid (e.g. DNA or RNA). The ligands can be oligomers of nucleic acid analogs (e.g. LNA). The ligands can be oligomers of nucleic acid mimics (e.g. PNA). The ligands can be chimeric oligomers. It is to be understood that a ligand that binds to rRNA is not necessarily inconsistent with the definition of &#x201c;probe&#x201d; presented below but that for purposes of this specification, &#x201c;labeled hybridization ligands that bind to rRNA&#x201d; has a special definition made with reference to markers used to stain cells.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;ligand pair&#x201d; refers to those molecules that bind to one or more other molecules in a specific manner. Because the ligand pair interactions are specific, there is a degree of selectivity that is achieved depending on the nature of the ligands chosen. Non-limiting examples of ligand pair complexes (formed from the component ligands) include antibody/antigen interactions, nucleic acid/nucleic acid interactions (including interactions of nucleic acids with nucleic acid analogs, nucleic acids with nucleic acid mimics, nucleic acids with chimeras as well as interactions between any combination of nucleic acid analogs, nucleic acid mimics and chimeras), enzyme/substrate interactions and receptor/ligand interactions. A non-limiting list of some ligands includes avidin (and its analogs such as streptavidin and Lumavidin&#x2122;), lectins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, nucleic acid analogs, nucleic acid mimics, chimeras, antibodies (and antibody fragments) peptides and proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, &#x201c;linker&#x201d; or &#x201c;cross linker&#x201d; refers to a single bond or to a composition capable of linking (or that links) a probe to a cell or a target to a support. Examples of linkers and cross linkers are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, &#x201c;marker&#x201d; refers to a composition suitable to mark a cell for determination. A marker comprises a detectable moiety or moieties but it is to be understood from the foregoing however, that a marker may differ from a detectable moiety in that a marker (as used herein) may also refer to a composition of which a detectable moiety is a subcomponent. For example, a marker can be a hybridization ligand comprising one or more detectable moieties wherein said hybridization ligand binds to rRNA of a cell (often referred to in the scientific literature as a ribosomal RNA probe) to thereby stain the cell. A marker can also be a labeled antibody (or antibody fragment) that interacts with, and thereby stains, a cell. In some embodiments, more that one marker (e.g. two hybridization ligands) or marker types (e.g. hybridization ligands and antibodies) can be used to stain a single cell. In some embodiments, a marker is simply a detectable moiety or detectable moieties (without any attached ligand that interacts with the cell) that directly interact with one or more components of the cell to cells to thereby stain the cell or cells (See for example: pages 11-13 of Product Literature, Invitrogen, <i>Tools for microbiology detection and research, </i>2007, 20 pages).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; refers to a nucleobase containing polymer formed from nucleotide subunits composed of a nucleobase, a ribose or 2&#x2032;-deoxyribose sugar and a phosphate group. Some examples of nucleic acid are DNA and RNA.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, &#x201c;nucleic acid analog&#x201d; refers to a nucleobase containing polymer formed from subunits wherein the subunits comprise a nucleobase and a sugar moiety that is not ribose or 2&#x2032;-deoxyribose and/or a linkage (between the sugar units) that is not a phosphate group. A non-limiting example of a nucleic acid analog is a locked nucleic acid (LNA: See for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,043,060, 7,053,199, 7,217,805 and 7,427,672). See: Janson and During, &#x201c;Peptide Nucleic Acids, Morpholinos and Related Antisense Biomolecules&#x201d;, Chapter 7, &#x201c;Chemistry of Locked Nucleic Acids (LNA)&#x201d;, Springer Science &#x26; Business, 2006 for a summary of the chemistry of LNA.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, &#x201c;nucleic acid mimic&#x201d; refers to a nucleobase containing polymer formed from subunits that comprise a nucleobase and a backbone structure that is not a sugar moiety but that can nevertheless sequence specifically bind to a nucleic acid. An example of a nucleic acid mimic is peptide nucleic acid (PNA: See for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,539,082, 5,527,675, 5,623,049, 5,714,331, 5,718,262, 5,736,336, 5,773,571, 5,766,855, 5,786,461, 5,837,459, 5,891,625, 5,972,610, 5,986,053, 6,107,470, WO92/20702 and WO92/20703). Another example of a nucleic acid mimic is a morpholino oligomer. (See: Janson and During, &#x201c;Peptide Nucleic Acids, Morpholinos and Related Antisense Biomolecules&#x201d;, Chapter 6, &#x201c;Morpholinos and PNAs Compared&#x201d;, Springer Science &#x26; Business, 2006 for a discussion of the differences between PNAs and morpholinos).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As used herein, &#x201c;nucleobase&#x201d; refers to those naturally occurring and those non-naturally occurring heterocyclic moieties commonly known to those who generate polymers that can sequence specifically bind to nucleic acids. Non-limiting examples of suitable nucleobases include: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, uracil, 5-propynyl-uracil, 2-thio-5-propynyl-uracil, 5-methylcytosine, pseudoisocytosine, 2-thiouracil and 2-thiothymine, 2-aminopurine, N9-(2-amino-6-chloropurine), N9-(2,6-diaminopurine), hypoxanthine, N9-(7-deaza-guanine), N9-(7-deaza-8-aza-guanine) and N8-(7-deaza-8-aza-adenine).

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used herein, &#x201c;operably links&#x201d; refers to linking a composition to another in such a way that one or both compositions remain operable. For example, with respect to linking a probe to a cell via a linker, the probe remains capable of binding to its respective target and the cell remains detectable or independently detectable (or capable of being made detectable or independently detectable). In this way, the linker operably links the cell to the probe.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein, the term &#x201c;peptide nucleic acid&#x201d; or &#x201c;PNA&#x201d; refers to any oligomer (that is not a chimera) comprising two or more PNA subunits (residues), including any of the polymers referred to or claimed as peptide nucleic acids in U.S. Pat.

Surfaces may be planar, substantially planar, or non-planar. Supports may be porous or non-porous, and may have swelling or non-swelling characteristics. A support may be configured in the form of a well, depression or other container, vessel feature or location. A plurality of supports may be configured in an array at various locations, addressable for robotic delivery of reagents, or by detection means including scanning by laser illumination and confocal or deflective light gathering.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, &#x201c;support-bound&#x201d; means immobilized on, or to, a support.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, &#x201c;tissue&#x201d; refers to an aggregate of cells, usually of a particular kind, together with their intercellular substance that form one of the structural materials of a plant, an animal or a human.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As used herein, &#x201c;under conditions suitable for the probe to bind to the target&#x201d; refers to conditions under which the probe binds to the target in a selective (i.e. specific) or substantially selective manner such that non-specific binding of probe to non-target moieties is minimized or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, &#x201c;uniquely identifiable&#x201d; refers to conditions under which two or more cells with distinguishable properties can be distinguished. For example, one cell may comprise red fluorescent markers and another cell may comprise green fluorescent markers. Accordingly, said two cells are uniquely identifiable using a properly equipped microscope (See for example: U.S. Pat. No. 6,656,687 at FIG. 6 and the associated discussion at Example 12) since the green cells can be distinguished from the red cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">4. General</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is to be understood that the discussion set forth below in this &#x201c;General&#x201d; section can pertain to some, or to all, of the various embodiments of the invention described herein.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Synthesis, Modification and Labeling of Nucleic Acids and Nucleic Acid Analogs</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Nucleic acid oligomer (oligonucleotide and oligoribonucleotide) synthesis has become routine. For a detailed description of nucleic acid synthesis please see Gait, M. J., &#x201c;Oligonucleotide Synthesis: a Practical Approach&#x201d; IRL Press, Oxford England. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotides (DNA, RNA and synthetic analogues thereof) are readily available. They can be synthesized using commercially available instrumentation and reagents or they can be purchased from commercial vendors of custom manufactured oligonucleotides.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">PNA Synthesis and Labeling</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Methods for the chemical assembly of PNAs are well-known (See: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,539,082, 5,527,675, 5,623,049, 5,714,331, 5,718,262, 5,736,336, 5,773,571, 5,766,855, 5,786,461, 5,837,459, 5,891,625, 5,972,610, 5,986,053 and 6,107,470; all of which are herein incorporated by reference for their information pertaining to peptide nucleic acid synthesis, modification and labeling. Chemicals and instrumentation for the support-bound automated chemical assembly of peptide nucleic acids are commercially available. Both labeled and unlabeled PNA oligomers are likewise available from commercial vendors of custom PNA oligomers (See the worldwide web at: 1) panagene.com/pna-oligomers.php, 2) biosyn.com/pna_custom.aspx or 3) crbdiscovery.com/pna/). Additional information on PNA synthesis and labeling can be found in Peter E. Nielsen, &#x201c;Peptide Nucleic Acids&#x201d;, Taylor and Francis, 2004.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Because a PNA is a polyamide, it has a C-terminus (carboxyl terminus) and an N-terminus (amino terminus). For the purposes of the design of a hybridization ligand (e.g. probe) suitable for antiparallel binding to a target (the preferred orientation), the N-terminus of the PNA oligomer is the equivalent of the 5&#x2032;-hydroxyl terminus of an equivalent DNA or RNA oligonucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Some non-limiting methods for labeling PNAs are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,676, WO99/22018, WO99/21881, WO99/49293 and WO99/37670 or are otherwise well known in the art of PNA synthesis.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Chimera Synthesis and Labeling/Modification</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Chimeras are oligomers comprising subunits of different monomer types. In general, it is possible to use labeling techniques (with or without adaptation) applicable to the monomer types used to construct the chimera. For example, labeling techniques used to label nucleic acids can usually be directly applied to LNA chimeras and other nucleic acid analogs. For nucleic acid mimics, such as PNA, peptide labeling techniques are often employed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Indeed, various labeled and unlabeled chimeric molecules are reported in the scientific literature or available from commercial sources (See: U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,230 and WO2001/027326 and See the worldwide web at: biosyn.com/PNA_Synthesis.aspx, and sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/custom-oligos/dna-probes/product-lines/Ina-probes.html). Therefore it is clear that persons of skill in the art can either prepare them or purchase them from readily available sources.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Antibody Preparation and Labeling</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Antibodies that bind to specific antigens can be produced by various methods (See for example: Jarvis et al., <i>Practical Platform, CENEAR, </i>87(30): 34-36 (2009)). Once raised to their antigen and isolated, the isolated antibodies (which are proteins) can be labeled and/or linked to other compositions such as a cell or a surface (See: Product Literature, <i>Invitrogen, Antibody Labeling From A to Z</i>, available as least as of October, 2009, 12 pages; Jin et al., <i>A Generalized Kinetic Model For Amine Modification Of Proteins With Application To Phage Display, BioTechniques, </i>46(3): 175-182 (2009)) and Miller, Steve, <i>Luciferase+Quantum Dot=Self Illuminating Nanocrystal Technologies</i>, Zymera, Inc. &#x26; Zymera 2009 Product List, 3 pages).</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Labels</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Non-limiting examples of detectable moieties (labels) suitable for directly labeling hybridization ligands, antibodies or antibody fragments or other compositions (e.g. to thereby generate a marker) used in the practice of this invention include a dextran conjugate, a branched nucleic acid detection system, a chromophore, a fluorophore, a spin label, a radioisotope, an enzyme, a hapten, a chemiluminescent compound, a quantum dot or a RFID tag, or any combination of two or more of the foregoing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Some examples of haptens include 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, 2,4-dinitrophenyl, digoxigenin, and biotin.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Some examples of fluorochromes (fluorophores) include 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (Flu), 6-((7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetyl)amino)hexanoic acid (Cou), 5 (and 6)-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX), Cyanine 2 (Cy2) Dye, Cyanine 3 (Cy3) Dye, Cyanine 3.5 (Cy3.5) Dye, Cyanine 5 (Cy5) Dye, Cyanine 5.5 (Cy5.5) Dye Cyanine 7 (Cy7) Dye, Cyanine 9 (Cy9) Dye (Cyanine dyes 2, 3, 3.5, 5 and 5.5 are available as NHS esters from GE Healthcare, Life Sciences, Piscataway, N.J.), JOE, TAMRA or the Alexa dye series (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.&#x2014;See for example: Product Literature, Invitrogen, <i>Alexa Fluor Dye Selection Guide</i>, available at least as of October, 2009, 48 pages).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Some examples of enzymes include polymerases (e.g. Taq polymerase, Klenow PNA polymerase, T7 DNA polymerase, Sequenase, DNA polymerase 1 and phi29 polymerase), alkaline phosphatase (AP), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and soy bean peroxidase (SBP).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Some examples of radioisotopes include <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>129</sup>I and <sup>99</sup>Tc.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, spin labels can be used to mark cells for determination. Spin labels are organic molecules which possess an unpaired electron spin, usually on a nitrogen atom. For example, oligomers can be labeled with a spin label as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,494,776. Said labeled oligomer can then, for example, be used as a marker to mark cells for determination.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, RFID tags can be used to mark cells for determination as described in published US Patent Application No: 2006/0199196 (See: paragraphs 79-94). Thus, in some embodiments, RFID tags themselves, or RFID tags linked to oligonucleotides (i.e. RFID tags linked to a ligand or ligands that bind to rRNA), can be used as markers.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to U.S. Pat. No. 7,498,177, a translocation peptide can be used in combination with quantum dots to thereby allow the quantum dots to penetrate into the nucleus of cells. Thus, in some embodiments, quantum dots can be used to mark cells for determination, whether or not linked to a ligand. Various types of quantum dots are known in the art. For example see: Miller, Steve, <i>Luciferase+Quantum Dot=Self Illuminating Nanocrystal Technologies</i>, Zymera, Inc. &#x26; Zymera 2009 Product List; and Product Literature &#x26; Product Listing, eBioscience, eFluor Nanocrystals, website<sub>&#x2014;</sub>2009, 10 pages.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Detectable and Independently Detectable Moieties/Multiplex Analysis</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments of this invention, a multiplex assay is performed. In a multiplex assay, numerous conditions of interest are simultaneously or sequentially examined. Multiplex analysis relies on the ability to sort sample components, or the data associated therewith, during or after the assay is completed. In a multiplex assay, one or more distinct independently detectable moieties (or a unique combination of moieties) can be used to uniquely mark (i.e. stain) two or more different cells wherein each uniquely marked cell (or cell type) comprises a unique linked probe that is directed to a unique target of interest (i.e. a unique &#x201c;select target&#x201d;). The ability to differentiate between and/or quantify each of the uniquely marked cells provides the means to multiplex the assay because the data that correlates with each uniquely marked (i.e. stained) cell can be correlated with the presence, absence, location and/or quantity of the unique target sought to be determined (See for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>). Consequently, the multiplex assays of this invention may be used to simultaneously or sequentially determine the presence, absence, location and/or quantity of two or more targets in the same sample and in the same assay.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Specificity:</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As noted above, probe/target complexes are formed under conditions that permit specificity of binding. Specificity of hybridization (i.e. the sequence specific binding of a hybridization probe to a nucleic acid target) is a function of various factors related to stringency and/or blocking strategy(ies). Specificity of binding also applies to antibody binding or the binding of members of any other type of ligand-ligand pair. Like hybridization specificity, specificity of binding of antibodies to antigens (or binding of one member of a ligand pair to another member) is also condition dependent. In principle, conditions are selected to optimize specificity so that non-specific binding is minimized or eliminated. Nevertheless, it is to be understood that specificity of binding is a relative term which also depends on many factors, including the nature (e.g. affinity) of the compositions forming the binding complex. Below is a non-limiting discussion of various conditions/considerations. Using no more than routine experimentation in combination with the disclosure provided herein, persons of skill in the art will be able to achieve suitable conditions so that binding (or hybridization) of particular probes to their respective targets is specific (such practice of the method produces an accurate and reproducible result). In some embodiments, this can be accomplished using commercially available buffers.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Blocking Probes:</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In hybridization reactions, blocking probes (made of nucleic acids, nucleic analogs, nucleic acid mimics and/or chimeras) can be used to suppress the binding of probes to a non-target and thereby improve specificity of the formation of probe/target complexes. Especially effective blocking probes are PNA oligomers (See: Coull et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,676, herein incorporated by reference and Fiandaca et al. &#x201c;PNA Blocker Probes Enhance Specificity In Probe Assays&#x201d;, Peptide Nucleic Acids: Protocols and Applications, pp. 129-141, Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK, 1999)).</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Hybridization Conditions/Stringency:</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that factors commonly used to impose or control stringency of hybridization include formamide concentration (or other chemical denaturant reagent), salt concentration (i.e., ionic strength), hybridization temperature, detergent concentration, pH and the presence or absence of chaotropes. Blocking probes (See the section immediately above for a discussion of blocking probes) may also be used as a means to improve discrimination beyond the limits possible by mere optimization of stringency factors. Optimal stringency for forming a probe/target complex is often found by the well-known technique of fixing several of the aforementioned stringency factors and then determining the effect of varying a single stringency factor. The same stringency factors can be modulated to thereby control the stringency of hybridization of a nucleic acid mimic, nucleic acid analog or chimera to a nucleic acid target (e.g. a sequence within rRNA, mRNA or chromosomal DNA), except that for some of these modified oligomers (e.g. PNA) the hybridization may be fairly independent of ionic strength. Optimal or suitable stringency for an assay may be experimentally determined by examination of each stringency factor until the desired degree of discrimination is achieved. Nevertheless, optimal stringency is not required. Rather, all that is required is that the non-specific binding of probes to their respective targets is minimized in the assay to the extent necessary to achieve an accurate and reproducible result. We refer to this as &#x201c;suitable hybridization conditions&#x201d;. As noted, various hybridization buffers (for hybridization events) and binding buffers (for binding events) are commercially available. Such buffers, in combination with temperature control, often produce suitable hybridization conditions or suitable binding conditions, as appropriate.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Suitable Antibody Binding Conditions</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Suitable antibody binding conditions comprise conditions suitable for binding an antibody to its antigen. Factors effecting antibody binding to its antigen (or for the binding of the ligands of a ligand-ligand complex) are substantially similar to those described above for hybridization and can be optimized in a similar manner. Suitable antibody binding conditions for various antibodies are known to persons of skill in the art. For those that are not, they can be determined. Suitable antibody binding buffers are also commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Therefore; using the disclosure provided herein; with or without additional routine experimentation, persons of skill in the art can determine suitable antibody binding conditions. By way of additional general guidance to the practitioner, methods for preparing and using antibodies can be found in numerous references including: Molecular Probes Of The Nervous System, Volume 1, &#x201c;Selected Methods For Antibody and Nucleic Acid Probes&#x201d;, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1993 by S. Hockfield et al.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Harmonization of Suitable Hybridization Conditions &#x26; Suitable Antibody Binding Conditions and Other Assay Requirements</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When practicing the methods disclosed herein, persons of skill in the art may find it useful to harmonize the hybridization conditions, antibody binding conditions and other assay conditions (or conditions for ligand-ligand binding). For example, in some embodiments, the staining of cells with one or more hybridization probes may be performed simultaneously with, prior to, or subsequent to, an antibody binding event. Because adjustment of the same variables (pH, salt concentration etc.) is commonly involved, aided by no more than routine experimentation, those of skill in the art will easily be able to harmonize conditions so that the assay produces a satisfactory result. A discussion of some of the problems and related solutions for harmonizing conditions for using antibody probes and hybridization probes in a single assay can be found in Goldbard et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,524,798) and A&#x3b2;mus et al., &#x201c;<i>Improved In Situ Tracking of Rhizosphere Bacteria Using Dual Staining with Fluorescence</i>-<i>Labeled Antibodies and rRNA</i>-<i>Targeted Oligonucleotides&#x201d;, Microb. Ecol., </i>33: 32-40 (1997). It is also worth noting that the use of nucleic acid mimics, such as PNA, can often simplify the harmonization process because some of these probe types bind to complementary nucleic acid (as compared with nucleic acid/nucleic acid interactions) under a wide range of conditions, thereby permitting one to tailor the conditions more closely to those suitable for the antibody-antigen and/or other ligand-ligand binding.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Cells</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With respect to cells used to form cell-linker-probe complexes, any single cell that can be marked for detection can be used. Thus, the cell can be a bacteria or yeast. The cell can be a single cell of the tissue of a multicellular organism such as an animal, plant or human. However, it is to be understood that some cell types will prove more useful than others. For example, cells that are robust or than can be easily manipulated within the context of a particular assay may prove to be more useful. Persons of ordinary skill in the art, exercising no more than routine experimentation and the discussion provided herein, will be able to test and determine which cell types are better suited for particular assays.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Cells can be easily marked for determination using various methods. The markers can mark any part of the cell. The markers can mark the surface of the cell (so long as it remains possible to link the probe to the cell), the cytoplasm of the cell (or components thereof) or the nucleus of the cell. The markers can mark two or more of the foregoing. It is to be understood that how the cell is marked is not a limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, cells can be marked using in-situ hybridization (See: U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,326 and published US patent application No. 2002/0142326). Both, universal or specific marker ligands (referred to as probes in the cited references but referred to herein as &#x201c;labeled hybridization ligands that bind to rRNA&#x201d;) can be used to mark various types of bacteria and/or yeast (See for example: U.S. Pat. No. 6,280,946, U.S. Pat. No. 6,664,045 and WO03/073817). The ligands can be modified with any suitable detectable moiety or moieties (label or labels), several of which are discussed above. Uniquely marked cells can be determined simultaneously using a microscope or slide scanner (See for example: U.S. Pat. No. 6,656,687, U.S. Pat. No. 6,664,045 and WIPO application No. 03/073817) or sequentially using a flow cytometer (See for example: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,981,180, 7,267,798 and WIPO application No. 03/073817). Various other methods for marking cells (including differentially marked cells) are known in the art (See for example: published WIPO application No. 03/073817).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is an advantage that the cells can be marked at any time. The cells can be marked (with the markers) before the assay is performed. The cells can be marked during the assay. The cells can be marked at any time prior to determining cell-linker-probe/target complexes. Thus, in some embodiments, it may be preferable to sell cell-linker-probe complexes wherein the cell(s) is/are unmarked. In some embodiments, it may be preferable to sell cell-linker-probe complexes where in the cell(s) is/are marked (i.e. stained).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, it may be preferable to sell one or more of the parts of a cell-linker-probe complex with or without additional reagents/instructions. For example, in some embodiments, it may be preferable to sell (for example a kit comprising) two or more of the components of the cell-linker-probe complex. For example, it may be preferable to sell (for example a kit comprising) probes and linkers (and optionally a marker) wherein a customer selects his/her own cell(s) such that the customer can prepare the cell-linker-probe complex. Alternatively, it may preferable to sell the cells (marked or unmarked) comprising a linker activated for attachment to a probe of the customer's selection. All other possible combinations of probe(s), linker(s), cell(s) and marker(s) are expressly contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Cell Functional Groups/Surface</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is to be understood that the cell of a cell-linker-probe complex is linked to the probe by a linker. Typically, the linking occurs by reaction of a functional group on the surface of the cell with a functional group of the linker or probe. Cells comprise numerous surface functional groups. For example, the hydroxyl, phenol, thiol, carboxy and amine groups of various amino acids of surface proteins are often accessible for this purpose. Similarly, the functional groups of various surface carbohydrates are also accessible for this purpose. These groups can also be used to introduce other functional groups onto the surface of the cell to thereby more easily link the probe to the cell. A listing of various nucleophilic and electrophilic functional groups that can be used can be found in the TABLE set forth below (under the heading: &#x201c;Functional Groups&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It is also to be understood that the phrase &#x201c;surface of the cell&#x201d; is intended to encompass more than just the outermost region of the cell. A cell surface is dynamic in composition and structure. For example, a surface protein to which a linker attaches (while functional groups of the protein is on its outermost surface) may reorient within the cell membrane such that the functional group to which the linker attached is now below the outermost surface, yet the probe remains operably linked to the cell. Therefore, &#x201c;surface of the cell&#x201d; is intended to encompass any molecule or structure associated with the cell's surface to which a linker or probe can be attached such that the probe remains &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; to the cell even if said attachment is somewhat below the outermost region of the cell (Also see the definition of &#x201c;surface of a cell&#x201d; at page 10, above).</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Cell Morphology</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It is an advantage of the present invention that certain types of cells possess a unique morphology. In addition to the markers, morphology of the cells can be used to either confirm the identity of a cell else introduce a second level of differentiation, for example, in a multiplex assay.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, bacilli tend to be rod-like whereas streptococci tend to be spherical (See the worldwide web at: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_cell_structure#Cell_morphology and en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bacterial_morphology_diagram.svg) In some assays, it may be that determining a yellow stained rod-like cell will confirm the presence, absence, location and/or quantity of a sought after target. In this case, the shape of the cell may be used to distinguish signal from noise in the assay.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Is some (multiplex) assays, multiple cell types may be used wherein at least two cell types of different morphology are stained with, for example, a yellow marker. In this case, the presence, absence, location and/or quantity of a particular target can be determined based, for example, on whether or not the yellow marked (i.e. stained) cell (of the cell-linker-probe/target complex) is identified as a rod or sphere. Of course an assay using this methodology can be further developed (further multiplexed) using cells of other known morphologies.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Probes</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Any probe that can be used to determine a select target and that can be operably linked to a cell is contemplated by this invention. The probe can be an oligomer (i.e. a nucleic acid, a nucleic acid analog, a nucleic acid mimic or a chimera). The probe can be an antibody or antibody fragment. The probe can be an aptamer. The probe can be a peptide or protein.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The probes specified herein are linked to the cell through a linker. Typically, the probe is linked to the linker by reaction of a functional group of the probe with a functional group of the linker. Thus, the probes disclosed herein will comprise a functional group. Said functional group can be native to the probe or be added by synthetic modification of the probe. A listing of various nucleophilic and electrophilic functional groups that can be used can be found in the TABLE set forth below. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine whether or not a probe requires modification. The nature and properties of the linker are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">It is to be understood that numerous probes exist in the biological arts and that the nature of a probe (for purposes of this invention) is not intended to be limited except as specifically disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Linkers</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Linkers can be used to link the probe to the cell. Linkers can also be used to link targets to surfaces. As used herein, the linker can be a covalent bond. If the linker is a covalent bond, a functional group of the probe reacts directly with a functional group of the surface of the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">However, the linker is more typically a carbon containing moiety comprising two (or more) functional groups, one functional group for linking the probe to the linker and one functional group for linking the cell to the linker. The two (or more) functional groups can be the same or they can be different. For example, the two functional groups of the linker can be the same; i.e. homobifunctional (e.g. both N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters) or different; i.e. heterobifunctional (e.g. one functional group can be a N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester and the other can be an isothiocyanate). Numerous alternative functional groups can be found in the TABLE, below.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, the linker can comprise from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. For example, a linker may comprise one or more aminoalkyl carboxylic acids (e.g. aminocaproic acid), the side chain of an amino acid (e.g. the side chain of lysine or ornithine), other natural amino acids (e.g. glycine, alanine, leucine, etc.), aminooxyalkylacids (e.g. 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid), alkyl diacids (e.g. succinic acid), alkyloxy diacids (e.g. diglycolic acid) or alkyldiamines (e.g. 1,8-diamino-3,6-dioxaoctane).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, a linker may have the formula: &#x2014;Y&#x2014;(O<sub>m</sub>&#x2014;(CW<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>)<sub>o</sub>&#x2014;Z&#x2014; wherein each end of the formula represents the attachment point to each of the probe and cell (in either orientation) and wherein the chemical linkages are omitted. The group Y can be a single bond.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">There are numerous commercially available linkers/cross linkers that can be used to link the cell to the probe. As noted, linkers can be homobifunctional or heterobifunctional. Various examples of suitable commercial cross-linkers that can be used to link the probes to the cells are available from Pierce Chemical Company (See: Pierce Catalog and Handbook, 1994, Section O, under the heading: &#x201c;Cross-linking/Protein Modification). Some other suitable linkers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,513. The linkers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,513 can be used to modify the probes wherein the aryl amine functional group of each linker used to link the linker (and hence also the probe) to a surface protein (or other membrane component) of the cell. Still other suitable cross linkers are described in Invitrogen, Product Literature, <i>Chemical Crosslinking Reagents</i>, Section 5.2 of Molecular Probes The Handbook, available at least as of October, 2009, 14 pages.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Moreover, the use of cross linkers to tether (i.e. link) living bacteria to silicon surfaces is described in Bearinger et al., <i>Chemical Tethering Of Motile bacteria to Silicon Surfaces, BioTechniques, </i>46(3): 209-216 (2009). These authors demonstrated that either amine groups of the cell surface or carboxy groups of the cell surface could be reacted with respective functional groups of the cross linkers to thereby immobilize the bacteria to the surfaces. According to applicant's invention, the cross linkers would be used to tether (i.e. link) a cell or cells (through functional groups present on the surface of the cell) to a probe or probes. The fact that the chemical tethering of bacteria to the silicon surfaces could be accomplished with various bacteria without killing the bacteria demonstrates that the conditions for linking the bacteria to surfaces or other structures, such as probes, is mild and not likely to render a probe non-operable for hybridization or binding under suitable hybridization conditions or suitable binding conditions (as appropriate).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">All of the foregoing examples are for illustration purpose and not intended to be limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">Functional Groups</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As noted above, in some embodiments a functional group of a cell reacts with a functional group of the linker (See for example: Bearinger et al., <i>Chemical Tethering Of Motile bacteria to Silicon Surfaces, BioTechniques, </i>46(3): 209-216 (2009) wherein the functional group of the cell can be either an amine or a carboxyl group). Similarly, a functional group of the probe reacts with a functional group of the linker (See for example: U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,676, WO99/22018, WO99/21881, WO99/49293 and WO99/37670). The result of these reactions is the cell-linker-probe complex. In practice, these reactions proceed essentially as described in for example: Product Literature, Invitrogen, <i>Chemical Crosslinking Reagents</i>, Section 5.2 of Molecular Probes The Handbook, available at least as of October, 2009, 14 pages, at for example FIG. 5.1 or 5.6, wherein R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>are the cell and the probe, or vice versa. As noted previously, numerous cross linkers are available and these illustrations are not intended to be limiting in any way. Similarly, cross linking reactions can be performed essentially as described in: Bearinger et al., <i>Chemical Tethering Of Motile bacteria to Silicon Surfaces, BioTechniques, </i>46(3): 209-216 (2009), wherein the cell-linker moiety is linked to a probe rather than to a silicon surface. The reactions are described in more general terms as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">It is well accepted that one of the two functional groups of each the cell/linker reaction and each linker/probe reaction is an electrophile and the other is a nucleophile. The table below lists various possible electrophilic and nucleophilic groups and the resulting chemical linkage. The covalent (chemical) linkage can be used to link a cell or probe to the linker using either orientation. Persons of skill in the art will recognize that properly functionalized cells, probes and linkers can be used to thereby form the cell-linker-probe complex.</p>

Operably Linking Probes to Cells
</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The probes are operably linked to the surface of the cells. By operably linked we mean that the probes, when linked to the cells, remain able to specifically bind to their respective targets and thereby form cell-linker-probe/target complexes under suitable hybridization/binding conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Generally speaking, linkers that enable the probe to distance itself from the cell are likely to be more suitable than embodiments where the probe is held in close relation to the cell. Simply stated, probes which are at a distance from the cell should be more easily able to interact with the target. Moreover, the phobicity or hydrophobicity of the linker may also vary and affect results. Preferred choices for the phobicity or hydrophobicity of the linker will depend on the assay conditions. However, the preferred length and/or composition of the linker can be determined using routine experimentation and the disclosure provided herein. Moreover, there is no requirement that the linker be optimized. Rather, it is only required that the linker operably link the probe to the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As noted above, various types of cross linkers can be used to link the probe to the cell. Some non-limiting examples of cross linkers that may be used are described in Pierce Catalog and Handbook, 1994, Section O, under the heading: &#x201c;Cross-linking/Protein Modification).</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Determining Cells, Targets &#x26; Correlation</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Cells can be determined using any applicable instrumentation and/or methodology. As noted above, microscopy, slide scanners and flow cytometers are particularly useful for determining stained cells. Other methods for determining stained cells can be found in WIPO application No. WO03/073817. In general, how the (stained) cells are determined is not a limitation of this method.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, the targets, as well as the cells, will comprise a detectable moiety or moieties (See for example; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). The methods selected to determine the cell will generally also be selected to determine the detectable moiety or moieties linked to the target.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As discussed in more detail below, the stained cells are correlated with the presence, absence, location and/or quantity of the target. This correlation can be made for both solution-based (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) and support-based assays (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). In general, this correlation is possible by confirming that a cell-linker-probe/target complex formed, thereby enabling the correlation between the stained cell and the target associated with a condition of interest.</p>
<heading id="h-0026" level="1">5. Various Embodiments of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">It should be understood that the order of steps or order for performing certain actions is immaterial so long as the present teachings remain operable or unless otherwise specified. Moreover, in some embodiments, two or more steps or actions can be conducted simultaneously so long as the present teachings remain operable or unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">Compositions:</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some embodiments, this invention pertains to a composition comprising a cell, a linker and a probe. The cell comprises a surface and a plurality of the same or different markers. The linker operably links the probe to the surface of the cell such that said probe is capable of binding to a target present outside of said cell. An illustration of a representative composition is found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Said composition is referred to herein as a &#x201c;Cell-Linker-Probe Complex&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The cell can, for example, be a bacteria or yeast. The cell can be a single cell of the tissue of a multicellular organism such as an animal, plant or human.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The probe can, for example, be a nucleic acid oligomer, a nucleic acid analog oligomer, a nucleic acid mimic oligomer or a chimera. The probe can, for example, be an antigen or an antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some embodiments, the markers can be labeled hybridization ligands that bind to rRNA of the cell. Said labeled hybridization ligands can be nucleic acid oligomers, nucleic acid analog oligomers, nucleic acid mimic oligomers or chimeras which are labeled with one or more detectable moieties. For example, said labeled hybridization ligands can be labeled with one or more fluorphores, chromophores, enzymes, haptens, radioisotopes, quantum dots or RFID tags, or any combination of two or more of the foregoing (i.e. as the detectable moieties). In some embodiments, the markers can be labeled antibodies (or antibody fragments) that bind to the cell surface and/or to components of the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Regardless of the nature of the marker, said cells become &#x201c;stained&#x201d; and therefore detectable using select instruments and/or associated protocols. For example, the &#x201c;stained&#x201d; cells can be determined using a fluorescent microscope, slide scanner or flow cytometer. Said instruments can be used to identify, locate and/or quantify said stained cells of a Cell-Linker-Probe Complex, and by implication identify, locate and/or quantify the linked probe and its related target if the probe is bound thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">According to practice of embodiments of the presently described invention, the probe selectively binds to its respective target under suitable hybridization (binding) conditions. Thus, in some embodiments, this invention is further directed to a composition (i.e. a complex) comprising a cell, a linker, a probe and a target. The cell comprises a surface and a plurality of the same or different markers. The linker operably links the probe to the surface of the cell such that said probe binds to the target existing outside of said cell. An illustration of a representative composition is found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Said composition is referred to herein as a &#x201c;Cell-Linker-Probe/Target Complex&#x201d;. As noted above, instruments/protocols can be used to identify, locate and/or quantify said stained cells of a Cell-Linker-Probe/Target Complex, and by implication the identity, locate and/or quantify of the linked target.</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">Methods:</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, this invention pertains to a method comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">a) contacting a sample comprising a target with a composition comprising a cell, a linker and a probe; wherein; i) said cell comprises a surface and a plurality of same or different markers, wherein said markers, in the aggregate, render said cell determinable (i.e. the markers stain the cell); and ii) said linker operably links said probe to said surface of said cell to thereby form a cell-linker-probe complex, such that said probe is capable of binding to said target present outside of said cell; and wherein said contacting occurs under conditions suitable (i.e. suitable hybridization conditions or suitable binding conditions, as appropriate) for said probe to (selectively) bind to said target; and</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">b) forming a cell-linker-probe/target complex;</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">c) determining presence, location and/or quantity of said markers associated with said cell; and</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">d) correlating the presence, location and/or quantity of said markers of said cell with a presence, location and/or quantity of said target.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">It is to be understood that when referring to &#x201c;bind&#x201d; or &#x201c;binding&#x201d; with respect to the above described method, if the probe is a hybridization probe, the terms &#x201c;bind&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;binding&#x201d; is/are intended to mean &#x201c;hybridize&#x201d; or &#x201c;hybridizing&#x201d; in this context.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">An example of forming the cell-linker-probe/target complex from the target and a cell-linker-probe complex is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, wherein the target is support-bound (i.e. linked to a surface by a linker). Consequently, for this embodiment, the presence and/or location of the markers associated with the cell (wherein the cell-linker-probe complex is selectively bound to the surface) correlates with the presence and/or location of the target on the support.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some embodiments, the sample can be an array wherein the array comprises a plurality of immobilized targets. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides an illustration of an array comprising a plurality of different targets.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The sample can be a fluid. The sample can be a tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The cell can, for example, be a bacteria or yeast. The cell can be a single cell of the tissue of a multicellular organism such as an animal, plant or human.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The probe can, for example, be a nucleic acid oligomer, a nucleic acid analog oligomer, a nucleic acid mimic oligomer or a chimera. The probe can, for example, be an antigen or an antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, the markers can be labeled hybridization ligands that bind to rRNA of the cell. Said labeled hybridization ligands can be nucleic acid oligomers, nucleic acid analog oligomers, nucleic acid mimic oligomers or a chimeras which are labeled with one or more detectable moieties. For example, said labeled hybridization ligands can be labeled with one or more fluorphores, chromophores, enzymes, haptens, radioisotopes, quantum dots or RFID tags, or any combination of two or more of the foregoing (i.e. as the detectable moieties).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Accordingly, said cells become &#x201c;stained&#x201d; and therefore detectable using select instruments/protocols. For example, the &#x201c;stained&#x201d; cells are detectable using a fluorescent microscope, slide scanner or flow cytometer. Said instruments can be used to identify, locate and/or quantify said stained cells.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">According to the methods, the cell-linker-probe/target complex is formed under conditions that promote selective binding of the probe to the target such that non-specific binding of the probe to non-targets is minimized or eliminated. For a more detailed discussion of specificity see the section entitled: &#x201c;Specificity&#x201d;, above.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As noted above, various types of instruments can be used to determine the stained cells. Since the stained cells are stained with markers, the operating parameters of the instrument(s) are selected to determine the markers present in the cell(s). In this way, the presence of the markers correlates directly with the presence of the cell(s).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some embodiments, merely a presence/absence determination is desired. For those applications, a flow cytometer would suffice since it is capable of determining the markers in the cells as each cell flows through the detector. For more information on flow cytometers and related protocols for cell analysis please see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,981,180, 6,268,222 and 7,267,798.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">For embodiments where knowledge of the location of the cell (for example on a surface) is desired, a microscope or slide scanner can be selected because each of these instruments is capable of determining location of the markers in at least 2 (if not 3) dimensions. Accordingly, a microscope or slide scanner can be used for determining location of the markers (and by inference location of the stained cells) on a surface or an array. In some cases, the cells themselves can be observed, including the morphology of the cell(s), which morphology may be useful to confirm identity (as discussed above).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">According to the method, the final step involves correlating the presence and/or location of the markers of the cell with presence and/or location of the target. For embodiments where the target is support-bound, this becomes a fairly straightforward task. Specifically, the cell-target-probe complex specifically interacts with, and becomes specifically immobilized to, the surface where the corresponding target to the probe of the cell-linker-probe complex exists (i.e. the cell-linker-probe/target complex forms where the target is immobilized to the surface). Accordingly, the presence and/or location of the stained cell(s) of the cell-linker-probe complex on the surface (or at a location on the surface) directly correlates with the presence and/or location of the target. By implication, the absence of a signal on the surface, or at locations where possible targets exist, will confirm the absence of the target sought to be determined on the surface or at that any particular location on the surface. In some embodiments, it may be possible to quantify the amount of target on the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">These principles likewise apply to tissue samples. In particular, the cell-probe-linker/target complex will form where (and if) the target is present in the tissue. Consequently, if the target is present, the presence and/or location of the cell of the cell-linker-probe complex in the tissue directly correlates with the presence and/or location of the target. By implication, the absence of a signal on the surface, or at locations where possible targets exist, will confirm the absence of the target sought to be determined in the tissue. In this way the presence and/or location of the markers of the stained cell(s) correlate with presence and/or location of the target in the tissue. In some embodiments, it may be possible to quantify the amount of target in the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">It is to be understood that in some embodiments, washing of the sample (e.g. an array or tissue) may be used to remove non-specifically bound cell-linker-probe complex(es) and thereby improve upon the reliability of the method. Persons of skill in the art will know how and when to perform such washing steps and be able to select effective reagents and procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some embodiments (e.g. where the sample is a fluid), the target itself can be labeled with one or more detectable moieties. Where the target itself is labeled, it is preferentially (but not necessarily) labeled with a moiety or moieties that are independently detectable as compared with the detectable moiety or moieties associated with the markers used to mark the cells. In this way, detection of the moiety or moieties that mark the cell in combination with detection of moiety or moieties that mark the target associated with a single composition (i.e. cell-linker-probe/target complex) will confirm the presence and/or location of the cell-linker-probe/target complex. In this way the presence and/or location of the markers of the cell correlate with presence and/or location of the target.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">An example of this embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. According to this illustration, the cell-linker-probe/target composition will comprise the purple detectable moiety (label) and the green detectable moiety (label). In this way the presence and/or location of the markers of the cell correlate with presence and/or location of the target. Because the cell-linker-probe complexes bearing blue, red or cyan markers don't comprise the probes for the select target, the purple label (and hence the target) does not associate/correlate with those compositions. Thus, the cell-linker-probe/target complex (comprising both a purple and green label) can be distinguished from the other cell-linker-probe complexes, for example, by flow cytometer having a detector set to screen for the purple label in combination with the other colored labels (i.e. the blue, red, green or cyan labels; see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) with respect to a single composition.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">a) contacting a sample with at least two different compositions; each of said at least two different compositions comprising: a cell (that differs from the other cell or cells of the other of said at least two different compositions), a linker and a probe, wherein: 1) said cell comprises a surface and a plurality of the same or different markers, wherein said markers, in the aggregate, render said cell uniquely determinable as compared with said other cell or cells of said other of said at least two different compositions; and 2) said linker operably links said probe to said surface of said cell, to thereby form a cell-linker-probe complex, such that said probe is capable of binding to a select target and wherein the contacting occurs under conditions suitable (i.e. suitable hybridization conditions or suitable binding conditions as the case may be) for the probe to (selectively) bind to said select target, if present, in the sample. The method further comprises: b) forming a cell-linker-probe/select target complex from at least one of said at least two different compositions; provided that the select target is present in said sample and further provided that said probe of each of said at least two different compositions selectively binds to a different select target; c) determining presence, location and/or quantity of each uniquely determinable cell associated with each different composition of said at least two different compositions; and d) correlating the presence, location and/or quantity of each uniquely determinable cell with a presence, location and/or quantity of each different select target, if present, in the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">According to the methods, each cell-linker-probe/target complex is formed under conditions that promote selective binding of each respective probe to its respective select target such that non-specific binding of the probe to non-targets is minimized or eliminated. For a more detailed discussion of specificity see the section entitled: &#x201c;Specificity&#x201d;, above.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">It is to be understood that when referring to &#x201c;bind&#x201d; or &#x201c;binding&#x201d; with respect to the above described method, if the probe is a hybridization probe, the terms &#x201c;bind&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;binding&#x201d; is/are intended to mean &#x201c;hybridize&#x201d; or &#x201c;hybridizing&#x201d; in this context.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some embodiments, the sample can be an array wherein the array comprises a plurality of immobilized targets. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c </i>illustrates an example of said multiple method whereby a mixture of four different uniquely identifiable (red, blue, green and cyan labeled) cell-linker-probe complexes is contacted with a 4&#xd7;5 target array wherein each spot (e.g. distinct array location) on the array comprises a different covalently linked target molecule (i.e. 20 different targets). As can be seen in the illustration provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>, each of the cell-linker-probe complexes binds to a different spot (i.e. array location) wherein binding correlates with the select target for each different probe of the different cell-linker-probe complexes. Thus, observing the red cell at array location B1 reveals that the target to the cell-linker-probe complex marked with the red stain is present at location B1. Similarly, observing each of the blue, green and cyan cells at array locations A5, C3 and D2, respectively, reveals that the select target for each of the corresponding marked cell-linker-probe complexes is present at these respective array locations.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">It is to be understood however that the sample need not be an array. The sample can be a fluid. The sample can be a tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The cell can, for example, be a bacteria or yeast. The cell can be a single cell of the tissue of a multicellular organism such as an animal, plant or human.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The probe can, for example, be a nucleic acid oligomer, a nucleic acid analog oligomer, a nucleic acid mimic oligomer or a chimera. The probe can, for example, be an antigen or an antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some embodiments, the markers can be labeled hybridization ligands that bind to rRNA of the cell. Said labeled hybridization ligands can be nucleic acid oligomers, nucleic acid analog oligomers, nucleic acid mimic oligomers or a chimeras which are labeled with one or more detectable moieties. For example, said labeled hybridization ligands can be labeled with one or more fluorphores, chromophores, enzymes, haptens, radioisotopes, quantum dots or RFID tags, or any combination of two or more of the foregoing (i.e. as the detectable moieties).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As previously noted, said cells become &#x201c;stained&#x201d; and therefore detectable using select instruments/protocols. For multiplex methods, the cells are uniquely identifiable. Thus, different cells comprise different markers, different combinations of markers or different ratios of the combination of the same markers such that the different cells are uniquely identifiable. As discussed previously, &#x201c;stained&#x201d; cells may be detectable using a fluorescent microscope, slide scanner or flow cytometer (depending on the nature of the marker(s)). Said instruments can be used to identify, locate and/or quantify said stained cells.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Further reference is made to the section above entitled &#x201c;Methods&#x201d; for a discussion of various ways to correlate markers of the respective cells with respective targets in array, tissue and fluid samples. It is to be understood that said correlations are equally applicable to the multiplex methods provided that the independently detectable cells are used to make independent determinations with respect to each of the respective select targets.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">An example of a solution-based multiplex method is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. According to this illustration, each cell-linker-probe/target complex will comprise the purple detectable moiety (label) linked to each respective target and a detectable moiety (label) based on the cell to which the corresponding probe is linked. In this way the presence and/or location of the markers of the respective cell correlates with presence and/or location of the respective target. Because the sample does not comprise the select target for the cell-linker-probe complex bearing blue markers, the purple label (and hence the target) does not associate/correlate with the cell-linker-probe complex marked with the blue markers. Thus, the cell-linker-probe/target complexes (comprising both a purple and respective, red, green or cyan labels) can be distinguished, for example, by flow cytometry.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">Quantification</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, the methods described above can include a quantification step whereby the target is quantified (rather than or in addition to determining the presence, absence and/or location of the target). Whether or not quantification is possible will depend on the nature of the detectable moiety or moieties selected and the instrumentation and/or methodology selected for detecting the detectable moiety or moieties. Persons of skill in the art will be able to select suitable labels, instruments and methods for quantification using no more than routine experimentation in combination with the guidance provided herein. Quantification can be applied to methods for determining single targets as well as to multiplex methods.</p>
